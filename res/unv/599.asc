<pre>Universal Dataset Number: 599

Name:   System - Stable Hierarchy Node
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
             Record 1: FORMAT(I10)
                       Field 1      - Number of Hierarchy Nodes
                                      (four list entries follow below for
                                      each node)
 
             Record 2: FORMAT(8I10)
                       Field 1      - Node-1 Child number
                       Field 2      - Node-1 Tag number
                       Field 3-4    - Starting and Ending element numbers
                                      into this record where Node-1's child
                                      entries may be found.  This may be =-1
                                      if the node has no children.
                       Field 5      - Node-2 Child number
                       Field 6      - Node-2 Tag number
                       Field 7-8    - Starting and Ending element numbers
                                      into this record where Node-2's child
                                      entries may be found.  This may be =-1
                                      if the node has no children.
                       Note: Repeat record 2 until the information for all of
                             the hierarchy nodes is written.
 
                       Note: This dataset is written out once for each
                             System.
