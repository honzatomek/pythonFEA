<pre>Universal File Datasets

Universal files are ASCII data files that can be used to store selected
information from a model file, to interface with programs of your own or
to transfer information between different types of computers.

The following are some reasons for using universal files:

¨      For small models, a universal file is smaller than a model file.

¨      You have more control over what is written to the file.

¨      In case of loss, it can serve as a backup to the model file.

Universal files are designed so that they may be easily read and written
using user-written programs. Each universal file is a sequential formatted
file with records a maximum of 80 characters. The file is compatible with
the text editor on the system.

Contents of Datasets

Blocks of information called datasets make up the basic structure of a
universal file. Each block begins with a line containing -1 and is a
dataset delimiter. This is a line containing a minus sign in column 5 and
a 1 in column 6. The remainder of the line is blank.

The second line has a number which is the dataset number. For example, the
connection grid specification for mesh volumes are written with dataset
number 785.

Following the data type record, the body of the dataset contains data
which is dependent on the dataset type. The final record of the dataset
contains a delimiter line containing a minus sign in column 5 and a 1 in
column 6 with the remainder of the line blank.

For example:

Note that each dataset begins with a delimiter and ends with a delimiter.
Between datasets, the file can contain lines (for example, comments),
which are not part of any dataset.

Processing of the Universal File

Processing of the universal file begins by searching for the first
delimiter line. Next, the dataset type line is processed to determine
whether or not the reading program should process this dataset. If the
dataset is to be processed, the program reads the data per the
specifications in the remainder of this section of the manual. If the
dataset is not to be processed by the program, the program continues
reading until the next delimiter line indicating the end of the dataset is
encountered.

The program next searches forward for the next delimiter indicating the
beginning of the next dataset. Processing of the next dataset continues as
above.

This processing continues dataset-by-dataset until the end-of-file
condition is reached. Note that an end of file condition encountered in
the middle of the dataset indicates that the dataset is not complete. The
end of file should always be encountered while looking for the beginning
of the next dataset to process.

Writing Your Own Universal File

Universal files written by the software generally contain more information
than you need to include if you plan to write your own file outside of the
I-DEAS software to import information. For example, files written by the
software contain information about the model file being used and active
units. When reading a file, these sections don't need to be present. There
is also information on the file describing things like color definitions,
viewport layout patterns, and light source definitions. If you are writing
a program to import data into I-DEAS, you can skip any information that
doesn't pertain to your application.
