                 Field 4       -- imaginary part of constraint coefficient
 
Records 3, 4, and 4+n are repeated for each multi-point
constraint equation of the constraint set.
 
The entire set of records, including the separators and the
dataset type records, is repeated for each constraint type of
each constraint set in the model.
 
Note: 1.) Systan only supports the multi-point constraint equation
          constraint type for displacements. It ignores the constraint
          set number, name, and color.
 
      2.) Supertab does not support complex data or the scalar dof
          for multi-point constraint equations.
