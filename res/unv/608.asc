Record 1:          Format (4I12)
                          Field 1           - solution set number (>0)
                          Field 2           - number of solution time points
                                              (L; L>0)
                          Field 3           - number of solution times at which
                                              restart data was saved
                                              (M; 0<=M<=L)
                          Field 4           - number of solution times at which
                                              output selection results exist
                                              (N; 0<=N<=L)

The solution set number must exist. Only one dataset 608 per solution set is
allowed.

Record 2:          Format (1P6E15.7)
                          Field 1-L       - list of solution time values
                                            (seconds) in sequential order 

Record 3:          Format (2I12)
                          Field 1         - solution time point number
                                            (>0; <=L)
                          Field 2         - number of striped restart
files
                                            for this solution time point
                                            (NS; 1<=NS<=4)

Record 4:          Format (40A2)
                          Field 1         - filename of 1st striped restart
                                            file
                              . . .
                          Field NS        - filename of NSth striped restart
                                            file

Repeat records 3 and 4 M times. If M=0, records 3 and 4 do not exist.

Record 5:          Format (3I12)
                          Field 1         - solution time point number
(>0; <=L)
                          Field 2         - solution set number containing
                                            results sets (>0)
                          Field 3         - number of results sets created for
                                            this solution time (NR; NR>0)


Record 6:          Format (8I10)
                          Field 1-NR      - list of results set numbers (>0)

Repeat records 5 and 6 N times. If N=0, records 5 and 6 do not exist. Solution
set in record 5 must exist. Results set numbers in records 6 must exist in the
solution set specified in record 5.
