<pre>Universal Dataset Number: 2428

Name:   Boundary Condition Sets
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Record 1:        FORMAT (I10)
                 Field 1       -- case set number

Record 2:        FORMAT (20A2)
                 Field 1       -- case set name

Record 3:        FORMAT (8I10)
                 Field 1       -- constraint set number
                 Field 2       -- restraint set number
                 Field 3       -- temperature set number
                 Field 4       -- kinematic dof set number
                 Field 5       -- master dof set number
                 Field 6       -- connection dof set number
                 Field 7       -- contact set number
                 Field 8       -- analysis type

Record 4:        FORMAT (1I10)
                 Field 1       -- number of load sets in the set

Record 5 - N+4:  FORMAT (8I10)
                 Fields 1-8    -- load set numbers

Note: N = Number of lines needed to write (Nls) load set numbers in 
I10 format each, eight per line. The last record can have less than
eight numbers.

The entire set of records, including the separator and
the dataset type records, is repeated for each boundary condition set
in the model.

Notes:

Analysis type has the following connotations:

1001   Linear Statics
1002   Linear Statics Adaptive
2001   Normal Mode Dynamics - SVI
2002   Normal Mode Dynamics - Guyan
2003   Normal Mode Dynamics - Lanczos
3001   Potential Flow
4001   Heat Transfer
5001   Constraint mode dynamics - SVI
5002   Constraint mode dynamics - Guyan
6001   Forced response
7003   Buckling
8001   Non Linear Statics
9001   No analysis type
10001  Linear Statics - P direct

The following analysis types are obsolete.  However,
if read into Master Series they will be converted:

7001   Linear Buckling
11001  Linear Statics - P iterative

* Linear Statics Buckling now uses the lanczos algorithm as opposed to
  the svi (iterative) algorithm.  Thus, 7001 will simply be converted to
  7003.

* Linear Statics, P Iterative is no longer a valid boundary condition
  type.  The boundary condition will simply become a Linear Statics, P
  Direct type.  Thus, 11001 will simply be converted to 10001.
