-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
             Record 1: FORMAT(I10,I2,I10)
                       Field 1      - Cutting Plane Id
                       Field 2      - Cutting Plane Operation Type
                                      = 1 - Keep Positive side
                                      = 2 - Keep Negative side
                       Field 3      - Color Number
 
             Record 2: FORMAT(1P4E16.7)
                       Field 1      - X coefficient for plane equation
                       Field 2      - Y coefficient for plane equation
                       Field 3      - Z coefficient for plane equation
                       Field 4      - Constant for plane equation
                                      Note: Plane equation is:
                                            Ax + By + Cz + D = 0
 
                 Note: This dataset will appear once for each Layout View
                       containing a Planar Section View.
