Name:   Load Cases
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Record 1:      Format (I10)
               Field 1            - Active load case number (>0)
                                    0 - no active load case
 
Record 2:      Format (5I10, 5A2, 5A2)
               Field 1            - Load case number (>0)
               Field 2            - Load case domain
                                    1 - Frequency
                                    2 - Time
               Field 3            - Number of excitation functions
                                    (0 < N < 100)
               Field 4            - Number of rotating force excitations
                                    (0 < N < 100)
                                    (Must be 0 for time domain)
               Field 5            - Number of unbalance excitations
                                    (0 < N < 100)
                                    (Must be 0 for time domain)
               Field 6            - Date created
               Field 7            - Time created
 
Record 3:      Format (40A2)
               Field 1            - Load case description
 
Record 4:      Format (8I10)
               Field 1-N          - List of excitation ID numbers (>0)
 
The excitaton must be listed in the order of functions, rotating forces,
and finally unbalances.  Each of the three groups of excitations must
begin
on a new line.  If the number of excitations is zero for a given group in
record 2, then record 4 does not exist for that group.
 
Repeat records 2, 3, and 4 for all load cases.
