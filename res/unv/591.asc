             Record 1: FORMAT(6I10)
                       Field 1      - Surface ID
                       Field 2      - Highlight color
                       Field 3      - Blanking status
                                      = 0 - Visible (unblanked)
                                      = 1 - Invisible (blanked)
                       Field 4      - Bin ID
                       Field 5      - Object ID
                       Field 6      - Number of surfaces
 
             Record 2: FORMAT(8I10)
                       Field 1      - Surface tag 1
                               .
                               .
                       Field 8      - Surface tag 8
                 Note: Repeat record 2 for as often as necessary to
                       include all surfaces.
 
             Record 3: FORMAT(8I10)
                       Field 1      - Label of surface 1
                               .
                               .
                       Field 8      - Label of surface 8
                 Note: Repeat record 3 for as often as necessary to
                       include all surfaces.
 
                 Note: Repeat records 1-3 for each Surface Set in an
                       NC Jobfile.
 
                 Note: This dataset is written once for each NC Jobfile.
