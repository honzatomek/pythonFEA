<pre>Universal Dataset Number: 589

Name:   2D Layout View - Key Dimension Mapping
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
             Record 1: FORMAT(3I10)
                       Field 1      - Key Dimension mapping ID
                       Field 2      - Entity ID
                                      < 0 - Entity Id; negative indicates
                                      entity contains dimensions that have
                                      been modified
                                      = 1 - When entity type is object or
                                      component (see field 1, record 1 of
                                      dataset 596)
                                      = N - When entity type is system, this
                                      entity ID is the hierarchy node number
                       Field 3      - Number of key dimensions
 
             Record 2: FORMAT(8I10)
                       Field 1      - First 3D key dimension ID
                       Field 2      - First associated 2D dimension ID
                       ...
                       Field 7      - Fourth 3D key dimension ID
                       Field 8      - Fourth associated 2D dimension ID
                 Note: Repeat record 2, as needed, for all of the key
                       dimensions (see field 3 of record 1) of the key
                       dimension mapping.
 
                 Note: Repeat records 1 & 2 for each entity in the current
                       layout view that has key dimensions.
 
                 Note: This dataset is written once for each 2D layout view.
 
                 Note: This dataset must be preceded by a dataset 596.  If
                       the 596 exists, then this 589 may exist, but this 589
                       cannot exist without a 596.
