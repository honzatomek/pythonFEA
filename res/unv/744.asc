-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Record 1:        FORMAT (5I10)
                 Field 1       -- curve label
                 Field 2       -- first endpoint label
                 Field 3       -- second endpoint label
                 Field 4       -- number of surfaces on which curve lies
                 Field 5       -- number of curves that were merged to
                                  form this curve
                               = 1 - if no curves were merged
 
Record 2:        FORMAT (1P3E13.5)
                 Field 1       -- x global cartesian midpoint coordinate
                 Field 2       -- y global cartesian midpoint coordinate
                 Field 3       -- z global cartesian midpoint coordinate
 
Record 3:        FORMAT (8I10)
                 Field 1       -- label of 1st surface on which curve lies
                 Field 2       -- label of 2nd surface on which curve lies
                                      ---
                                      ---
                 Field 8       -- label of 8th surface on which curve lies
 
Repeat record 3 until surfaces are exhausted.
 
Record 4:        FORMAT (1P6E13.5)
                 Field 1       -- ratio of arc lengths of 1st region to total
                 Field 2       -- ratio of arc lengths of 2nd region to total
                                      ---
                                      ---
                 Field 3       -- ratio of arc lengths of 6th region to total
 
Repeat record 4 until merged regions are exhausted.
 
Records 1 thru 4 are repeated for each curve in the working set.
