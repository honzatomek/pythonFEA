                       Field 3-4    - X,Y Coordinates of Second Pick Location
                 Note: Repeat records 1-2 for each Geometric Constraint owned
                       by the Profile.
 
                 Note: This dataset is written out once for each profile that
                       has Geometric Constraints applied to it.
