<pre>Universal Dataset Number: 555

Name:   Leaf - Primitive Surface Associativity Map
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
             Record 1: FORMAT(32I2)
                       Field 1      - Primitive Surface Associativity Map
                 Note: 1) The number of values in record 1 is equal to the
                       number of surfaces generated by the leaf owner of this
                       PSAM squared (NUMSURF*NUMSURF).
                       2) Repeat record 1 until all of the values are
                       written.
 
             Record 2: FORMAT(8I10)
                       Field 1      - Original Bounding Surface List
                 Note: 1) Record 2 is only written out for Fillet and Round
                       Tool leaves.
                       2) The number of values for record 2 is equal to 5
                       times the number of surfaces generated by the leaf
                       owner of this PSAM (5*NUMSURF).
                       3) Repeat record 2 until all of the values are
                       written.
 
                 Note: 1) This dataset is written out once for each Extrude,
                       Revolve, Sectional Skin Group, and Fillet and Round
                       Tool leaves.
