Record 1:        FORMAT (3I10,1P1E13.5)
                 Field 1       -- label of working set point for which
                                  this data applies
                 Field 2       -- label of curve for which point is a midpoint
                               = -1 - point is not midpoint of a curve
                 Field 3       -- number of surfaces on which point lies
                 Field 4       -- grading value
 
Record 2:        FORMAT (8I10)
                 Field 1       -- label of 1st surface on which point lies
                 Field 2       -- label of 2nd surface on which point lies
                                        ---
                                        ---
                 Field 8       -- label of 8th surface on which point lies
 
Repeat record 2 until surfaces on which the point lies are exhausted.
 
Records 1 and 2 are repeated for each point in the working set.
