             Record 1: FORMAT (5I10,10A2,2I5)
                       Field 1      - Hierarchy node number
                                      = 1 - root hierarchy node
                                      > 0 - node number in hierarchy tree
                       Field 2      - Stored entity's bin number
                       Field 3      - Stored entity's number in the bin
                       Field 4      - Child number
                       Field 5      - Instance number
                       Field 6      - Instance name
                       Field 7      - Stored entity's type
                                      = 0 - Component
                                      = 1 - System
                       Field 8      - Blanking status
                                      Bit n: = 0 - Visible (unblanked)
                                             = 1 - Invisible (blanked)
                                      Bit 1: Auxiliary Geometry
                                      Bit 2: Selected Object
                                      Bit 3: Abstract Object
                                      Bit 4: Selected Wireframe
 
             Record 2: FORMAT (1P3D26.17)
                       Fields 1-3   - Rotation relative to parent
                                      (elements A-C)
 
             Record 3: FORMAT (1P3D26.17)
                       Fields 1-3   - Rotation relative to parent
                                      (elements D-F)
 
             Record 4: FORMAT (1P3D26.17)
                       Fields 1-3   - Rotation relative to parent
                                      (elements G-I)
 
             Record 5: FORMAT (1P3D26.17)
                       Fields 1-3   - Translation relative to parent
                                      (elements J-L)
 
                       Note:  Records 1-5 repeat for the "root" node and
                              each "1st level child" of the parent system.
 
                       Note:  Records 2-5 (i.e. Element A-L) are used to
                              form a 4x4 unitary transformation matrix of
                              the following format:
 
                      A D G J        X            X
                      B E H K        Y      =     Y
                      C F I L        Z            Z
                      0 0 0 1        1            1
 
                                   Entity        Parent
                                    Space         Space
 
Note:  Since no owner system information is included in this Dataset, it is
assumed that this hierarchy data will be used to build the hierarchy of the
system currently being read in (i.e. add the hierarchy nodes to the system
specified by the last system header Dataset).
 
Note:  No display attributes data is included in this dataset since this
functionality was not implemented in I-DEAS V4.0.  The display attribute fields
of the hierarchy node records should use the display attribute values of the
stored entity.
