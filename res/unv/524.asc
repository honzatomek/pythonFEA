                       a 4X4 unitary transformation matrix.  It is used to
                       map a coordinate in local space into global space.
                       The matrix is in the following format:

                       in the loop.
 
                 Note: Repeat record 11 for each section point in the
                       curve (fit) that has a non-zero original Profile Fit Id.
 
                 Note: Write record 11 once more, after the other curve
                       points are written, for the Curve (fit) centerpoint
                       if it has one (i.e. Id > 0; circular arc forms only).
 
                 Note: Repeat records 40 and 7 through 11 for each loop
                       in the section profile.
 
                 Note: Repeat records 35 through 40 and 7 through 11

                       Field 1-8    - Section Map Data
                 Note: Repeat record 42 until all of the section map
                       data is written (4*number of rows).
 
            Record 43: FORMAT(1P5E16.7)

                                      (XYZ)

                       start point coordinates are written (3*number of
                       section curve start points).

                       Field 8      - Number of points in Section-8
                 Note: Repeat record 44 until the number of points is
                       written out for each section (number of sections).
 
                 Note: Repeat records 41-44 for the number of loops in the
                       section profile.  (For example, if a skin group
                       has 5 sections, and each section has 2 loops
                       then records 41-44 will be written out twice.)
 
                 Note: This dataset is written out once for each Sectional
                       Skin Group.
