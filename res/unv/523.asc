Name:   Profile - External Constraints
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
             Record 1: FORMAT(4I10)
                       Field 1      - External Constraint Id
                       Field 2      - External Constraint type
                                      = 0 - External Equation
                                      = 1 - Functional Equation
                                      = 2 - Initial Condition
                       Field 3      - Integer Equation data
                                      type = 0: (Not Used)
                                      type = 1: Dimension Id
                                      type = 2: VG Variable Id which the
                                      Initial Condition applies to
                       Field 4      - Number of lines of Equation text
 
             Record 2: FORMAT(40A2)
                       Field 1      - Lines of Equation text
                 Note: Repeat record 2 for each line of Equation text
 
                 Note: Repeat records 1-2 for each External Constraint owned
                       by the Profile.
 
                 Note: This dataset is written out once for each profile that
                       has External Constraints applied to it.
