                       Field 1-2    - X,Y Coordinates of First Pick Location

                       Field 5      - Tolerance Values
                 Note: Repeat records 1-2 for each Geometric Constraint owned
                       by the Tolerance Analysis Model.
 
                 Note: This dataset is written out once for each TAM that
                       has Geometric Constraints applied to it.
