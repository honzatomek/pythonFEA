      <b>hypersphere_angle_test</b>,
      a MATLAB code which 
      calls hypersphere_angle(), which
      computes the expected value of the angle
      between a pair of points randomly selected on the unit hypersphere
      in M dimensions.  Since by symmetry, this will be zero, we instead look
      at the average of the absolute value of the dot product, and the
      corresponding angle.  This starts out at 1 for dimension 1, and
      rapidly decreases as the spatial dimension increases.
