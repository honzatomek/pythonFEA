%% voronoi_polygon_vertices() computes the vertices of a Voronoi polygon.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    This routine is only appropriate for Voronoi polygons that are finite.
%
%    The routine is given the indices of the nodes that are neighbors of a 
%    given "center" node.  A node is a neighbor of the center node if the
%    Voronoi polygons of the two nodes share an edge.  The triangles of the 
%    Delaunay triangulation are formed from successive pairs of these neighbor 
%    nodes along with the center node.
%
%    Given only the neighbor node information, it is possible to determine
%    the location of the vertices of the polygonal Voronoi region by computing
%    the circumcenters of the Delaunay triangles.
%
%    It is assumed that this subroutine is being called by a process which has 
%    computed the Voronoi diagram of a large set of nodes, so the arrays X and 
%    Y are dimensioned by NODE_NUM, which may be much greater than the number 
%    of neighbor nodes.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer NODE, the index of the node whose Voronoi
%    polygon is to be analyzed.  1 <= NODE <= NODE_NUM.
%
%    integer NEIGHBOR_NUM, the number of neighbor nodes of
%    the given node.
%
%    integer NEIGHBOR_INDEX(NEIGHBOR_NUM), the indices
%    of the neighbor nodes.  These indices are used to access the
%    X and Y arrays.  The neighbor nodes should be listed in the
%    (counter-clockwise) order in which they occur as one circles 
%    the center node.
%
%    integer NODE_NUM, the total number of nodes.
%
%    real NODE_XY(2,NODE_NUM), the nodes.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real V(2,NEIGHBOR_NUM), the coordinates of 
%    the vertices of the Voronoi polygon around node NODE.
