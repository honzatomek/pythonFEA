%% triangulation_delaunay_discrepancy_compute() reports if a triangulation is Delaunay.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    A (maximal) triangulation is Delaunay if and only if it is locally
%    Delaunay.
%
%    A triangulation is Delaunay if the minimum angle over all triangles
%    in the triangulation is maximized.  That is, there is no other
%    triangulation of the points which has a larger minimum angle.
%
%    A triangulation is locally Delaunay if, for every pair of triangles
%    that share an edge, the minimum angle in the two triangles is larger
%    than the minimum angle in the two triangles formed by removing the
%    common edge and joining the two opposing vertices.
%
%    This function examines the question of whether a given triangulation
%    is locally Delaunay.  It does this by looking at every pair of
%    neighboring triangles and comparing the minimum angle attained
%    for the current triangle pair and the alternative triangle pair.
%
%    Let A(i,j) be the minimum angle formed by triangles T(i) and T(j),
%    which are two triangles in the triangulation which share a common edge.
%    Let B(I,J) be the minimum angle formed by triangles S(i) and S(j),
%    where S(i) and S(j) are formed by removing the common edge of T(i)
%    and T(j), and joining the opposing vertices.
%
%    Then the triangulation is Delaunay if B(i,j) <= A(i,j) for every
%    pair of neighbors T(i) and T(j).
%
%    If A(i,j) < B(i,j) for at least one pair of neighbors, the triangulation
%    is not a Delaunay triangulation.
%
%    This program returns VALUE = min ( A(i,j) - B(i,j) ) over all
%    triangle neighbors.  VALUE is scaled to be in degrees, for
%    comprehensibility.  If VALUE is negative, then at least one pair
%    of triangles violates the Delaunay condition, and so the entire
%    triangulation is not a Delaunay triangulation.  If VALUE is nonnegative,
%    then the triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation.
%
%    It is useful to return VALUE, rather than a simple True/False value,
%    because there can be cases where the Delaunay condition is only
%    "slightly" violated.  A simple example is a triangulation formed
%    by starting with a mesh of squares and dividing each square into
%    two triangles by choosing one of the diagonals of the square.
%    The Delaunay discrepancy for this mesh, if computed exactly, is 0,
%    but roundoff could easily result in discrepancies that were very
%    slightly negative.
%
%    If VALUE is positive, and not very small in magnitude, then every
%    pair of triangles in the triangulation satisfies the local Delaunay
%    condition, and so the triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation.
%
%    If VALUE is negative, and not very small in magnitude, then at least
%    one pair of triangles violates the Delaunay condition, and to a
%    significant degree.  The triangulation is not a Delaunay triangulation.
%
%    If the magnitude of VALUE is very close to zero, then the triangulation
%    is numerically ambiguous.  At least one pair of triangles violates
%    or almost violates the condition, but no triangle violates the
%    condition to a great extent.  The user must judge whether the
%    violation is significant or not.
