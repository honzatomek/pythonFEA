%% triangulation_order3_quad() approximates an integral over a triangulation.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The routine will accept triangulations of order higher than 3.
%    However, only the first three nodes (the vertices) of each
%    triangle will be used.  This will still produce correct results
%    for higher order triangulations, as long as the sides of the
%    triangle are straight.
%
%    We assume that the vertices of each triangle are listed first
%    in the description of higher order triangles, and we assume that
%    the vertices are listed in counterclockwise order.
%
%    The approximation of the integral is made using a quadrature rule 
%    defined on the unit triangle, and supplied by the user.  
%
%    The user also supplies the name of a function, here called "QUAD_FUN",
%    which evaluates the integrand at a set of points.  The form is:
%
%      function f_vec = quad_fun ( n, xy_vec )
%
%    and it returns in each entry F_VEC(1:N), the value of the integrand
%    at XY_VEC(1:2,1:N).

%  Input:

%    integer TRIANGLE_NUM, the number of triangles in the triangulation.
%
%    integer TRIANGLE_NODE(TRIANGLE_ORDER,TRIANGLE_NUM),

%
%    function FVEC(1:N) = QUAD_FUN( N, XY_VEC(1:2,1:N), the name of the
