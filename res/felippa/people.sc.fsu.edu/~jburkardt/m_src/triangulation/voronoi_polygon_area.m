%% voronoi_polygon_area() computes the area of a Voronoi polygon in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    It is assumed that the Voronoi polygon is finite!  Every Voronoi
%    diagram includes some regions which are infinite, and for those,
%    this formula is not appropriate.
%
%    The routine is given the indices of the nodes that are neighbors of a 
%    given "center" node.  A node is a neighbor of the center node if the
%    Voronoi polygons of the two nodes share an edge.  The triangles of the 
%    Delaunay triangulation are formed from successive pairs of these neighbor 
%    nodes along with the center node.
%
%    The assumption that the polygon is a Voronoi polygon is
%    used to determine the location of the boundaries of the polygon,
%    which are the perpendicular bisectors of the lines connecting
%    the center point to each of its neighbors.
%
%    The finiteness assumption is employed in part in the
%    assumption that the polygon is bounded by the finite
%    line segments from point 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ...,
%    M-1 to M, and M to 1, where M is the number of neighbors.
%
%    It is assumed that this subroutine is being called by a
%    process which has computed the Voronoi diagram of a large
%    set of nodes, so the arrays X and Y are dimensioned by
%    NODE_NUM, which may be much greater than the number of neighbor
%    nodes.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer NODE, the index of the node whose Voronoi
%    polygon is to be measured.  1 <= NODE <= NODE_NUM.
%
%    integer NEIGHBOR_NUM, the number of neighbor nodes of
%    the given node.
%
%    integer NEIGHBOR_INDEX(NEIGHBOR_NUM), the indices
%    of the neighbor nodes (used to access X and Y).  The neighbor
%    nodes should be listed in the (counter-clockwise) order in
%    which they occur as one circles the center node.
%
%    integer NODE_NUM, the total number of nodes.
%
%    real NODE_XY(2,NODE_NUM), the nodes.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real AREA, the area of the Voronoi polygon.
