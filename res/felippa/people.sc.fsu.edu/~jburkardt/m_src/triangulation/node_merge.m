%% node_merge() detects nodes that should be merged.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Two nodes "should" be merged if they are within TOLERANCE distance
%    of each other.
%
%    With a tolerance of 0, only exactly equal nodes are counted.
%
%    With a positive tolerance, a pair of nodes inside a circle of
%    radius TOLERANCE result in a count of 1 duplicate.
%
%    However, what do we do if nodes A, B and C are arranged in a line,%
%    with A and B just within TOLERANCE of each other, and B and C just
%    within tolerance of each other?  What we do here is make a choice
%    that can be defended consistently.  A and B define an equivalence
%    class because they are closer than TOLERANCE.  C is then added to
%    this equivalence class, because it is within TOLERANCE of at least
%    on thing in that equivalence class.
%
%    Thus, if 100 nodes are separated pairwise by slightly less
%    than TOLERANCE, a total of 99 duplicates will be counted.
%
%    The program starts out by giving each node its own label.
%    If it finds that two nodes should be merged, then the index of
%    one node is used as the label for both.  This process continues
%    until all nodes have been considered.  The number of unique nodes
%    is the number of unique values in the output quantity NODE_REP.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer DIM_NUM, the spatial dimension.
%
%    integer NODE_NUM, the number of nodes.
%
%    real NODE_XY(DIM_NUM,NODE_NUM), the nodes.
%
%    real TOLERANCE, the maximum distance between
%    two nodes regarded as duplicate.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer NODE_REP(NODE_NUM), the "representative" of each node.
%    NODE_REP(NODE) is the index of a node which is within TOLERANCE of node
%    NODE, or for which a chain of nodes can be found, all having the
%    same representative, and all of which are pairwise closer than TOLERANCE.
