      <b>circle_grid_display</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      reads a matrix of integers, and draws a
      corresponding grid of circles filled with color.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program will display a grid of circles filled with colors
      according to the values in the matrix:
      <ul>
        <li>
          0: white
        </li>
        <li>
          1: red
        </li>
        <li>
          2: green
        </li>
        <li>
          3: blue
        </li>
        <li>
          4: cyan
        </li>
        <li>
          5: yellow
        </li>
        <li>
          6: magenta
        </li>
        <li>
          7: black
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      This program was designed in particular to make it possible to illustrate
      individual steps in the evolution of John Conway's Game of Life.
