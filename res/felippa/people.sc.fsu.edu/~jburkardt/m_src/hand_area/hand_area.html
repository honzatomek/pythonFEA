    <p>
      <b>hand_area</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      starts with data points defining the outline of someone's hand,
      and then estimate the area of the hand using sampling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original proposer of this exercise was Cleve Moler, in the
      textbook <i>Numerical Computing with MATLAB</i>.
