    <p>
      <b>triangulation_triangle_neighbors</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      computes the three
      neighboring triangles of each triangle in a triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user supplies a node file and a triangle file, containing
      the coordinates of the nodes, and the indices of the nodes that
      make up each triangle.  Either 3-node or 6-node triangles may
      be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program reads the data, computes the triangle neighbor information,
      and writes out the information to a file.  In cases where one side
      of a triangle has no triangle neighbor, a value of -1 is assigned.
    </p>

    <p>
      The triangle neighbor array is useful if the triangulation has
      to be searched to find the triangle containing a given point.
      It is also useful when analyzing the bandwidth of the adjacency
      matrix, or of a finite element matrix derived from the triangulation.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i><b>_nodes.txt</b>,    the node coordinates (input);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i><b>_elements.txt</b>,    the triangulation (input);
        </li>
        <li>
