function [ n, a ] = rat_to_cfrac ( p, q )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% rat_to_cfrac() converts a rational value to a continued fraction.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The routine is given a rational number represented by P/Q, and
%    computes the monic or "simple" continued fraction representation
%    with integer coefficients of the number:
%
%      A(1) + 1/ (A(2) + 1/ (A(3) + ... + 1/A(N) ...))
%
%    The user must dimension A to a value M which is "large enough".
%    The actual number of terms needed in the continued fraction
%    representation cannot be known beforehand.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer P, Q, the numerator and denominator of the
%    rational value whose continued fraction representation is
%    desired.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer N, the number of entries in A.
%
%    integer A(N), contains the continued fraction
%    representation of the number.
