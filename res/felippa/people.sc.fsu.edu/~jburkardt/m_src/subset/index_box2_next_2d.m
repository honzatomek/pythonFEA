%% index_box2_next_2d() produces index vectors on the surface of a box in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The box is has center at (IC,JC), and has half-widths N1 and N2.
%    The index vectors are exactly those which are between (IC-N1,JC-N1) and
%    (IC+N1,JC+N2) with the property that at least one of I and J
%    is an "extreme" value.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N1, N2, the half-widths of the box, that is, the
%    maximum distance allowed between (IC,JC) and (I,J).
%
%    integer IC, JC, the central cell of the box.
%
%    integer I, J, the output value of I and J on the previous call.
%    Input values ignored on first call.
%
%    logical MORE, set this to 0 on the first call, and therafter,
%    set it to its output value on the previous call.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer I, J, the next index set.
%
%    logical MORE, is FALSE (or 0) if there are no more indices
%    to return, and TRUE otherwise.

%
%  Increment J.

%  Check J.
