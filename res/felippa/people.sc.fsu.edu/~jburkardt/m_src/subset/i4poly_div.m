function [ nq, q, nr, r ] = i4poly_div ( na, a, nb, b )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% i4poly_div() computes the quotient and remainder of two polynomials.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Normally, the quotient and remainder would have rational coefficients.
%    This routine assumes that the special case applies that the quotient
%    and remainder are known beforehand to be integral.
%
%    The polynomials are assumed to be stored in power sum form.
%
%    The power sum form is:
%
%      p(x) = a(0) + a(1)*x + ... + a(n-1)*x^(n-1) + a(n)*x^(n)
%
%    Since MATLAB will not allow 0-based indices, the algorithm has been
%    crudely modified by adding one to all array indices.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer NA, the dimension of A.
%
%    integer A(1:NA+1), the coefficients of the polynomial to be divided.
%
%    integer NB, the dimension of B.
%
%    integer B(1:NB+1), the coefficients of the divisor polynomial.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer NQ, the degree of Q.
%    If the divisor polynomial is zero, NQ is returned as -1.
%
%    integer Q(1:NA-NB+1), contains the quotient of A/B.
%    If A and B have full degree, Q should be dimensioned Q(1:NA-NB+1).
%    In any case, Q(1:NA+1) should be enough.
%
%    integer NR, the degree of R.
%    If the divisor polynomial is zero, NR is returned as -1.
%
%    integer R(1:NB), contains the remainder of A/B.
%    If B has full degree, R should be dimensioned R(1:NB).
%    Otherwise, R will actually require less space.
