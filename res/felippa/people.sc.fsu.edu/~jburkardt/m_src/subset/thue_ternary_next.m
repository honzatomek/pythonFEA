%% thue_ternary_next() returns the next element in a ternary Thue sequence.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Thue was interested in showing that there were arbitrarily long
%    sequences of digits which never displayed a pair of contiguous
%    repetitions of any length.  That is, there was no occurrence of
%    "00" or "1010" or "121121", anywhere in the string.  This makes
%    the string "squarefree".
%
%    To do this, he demonstrated a way to start with a single digit,
%    and to repeatedly apply a series of transformation rules to each
%    digit of the sequence, deriving nonrepeating sequences of ever
%    greater length.
%
%    In this example, the digits allowed are ternary, that is, just
%    "0", "1" and "2".  The replacement rules are:
%
%    "0" -> "12"
%    "1" -> "102"
%    "2" -> "0"
%
%    This routine produces the next Thue sequence in a given series.
%    However, the input sequence must be a Thue sequence in order for
%    us to guarantee that the output sequence will also have the
%    nonrepetition property.
%
%    Also, enough space must be set aside in THUE to hold the
%    output sequence.  This will never be more than 3 times the input
%    value of N.
