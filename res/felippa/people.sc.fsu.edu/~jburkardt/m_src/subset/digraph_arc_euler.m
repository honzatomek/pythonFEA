%% digraph_arc_euler() returns an Euler circuit in a digraph.
%
%  Description:
%
%    An Euler circuit of a digraph is a path which starts and ends at
%    the same node and uses each directed edge exactly once.  A digraph is
%    eulerian if it has an Euler circuit.  The problem is to decide whether
%    a given digraph is eulerian and to find an Euler circuit if the
%    answer is affirmative.
%
%    A digraph has an Euler circuit if and only if the number of incoming
%    edges is equal to the number of outgoing edges at each node.
%
%    This characterization gives a straightforward procedure to decide whether
%    a digraph is eulerian.  Furthermore, an Euler circuit in an eulerian
%    digraph G of NEDGE edges can be determined by the following method:
%
%      STEP 1: Choose any node U as the starting node, and traverse any edge
%      ( U, V ) incident to node U, and than traverse any unused edge incident
%      to node U.  Repeat this process of traversing unused edges until the
%      starting node U is reached.  Let P be the resulting walk consisting of
%      all used edges.  If all edges of G are in P, than stop.
%
%      STEP 2: Choose any unused edge ( X,  Y) in G such that X is
%      in P and Y is not in P.  Use node X as the starting node and
%      find another walk Q using all unused edges as in step 1.
%
%      STEP 3: Walk P and walk Q share a common node X, they can be merged
%      to form a walk R by starting at any node S of P and to traverse P
%      until node X is reached; than, detour and traverse all edges of Q
%      until node X is reached and continue to traverse the edges of P until
%      the starting node S is reached.  Set P = R.
%
%      STEP 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all edges are used.
%
%    The running time of the algorithm is O ( NEDGE ).
%
%    The digraph is assumed to be connected.
