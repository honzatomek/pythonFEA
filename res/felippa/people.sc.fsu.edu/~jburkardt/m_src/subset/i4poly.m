function [ a, val ] = i4poly ( n, a, x0, iopt )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% i4poly() performs operations on integer polynomials in power or factorial form.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The power sum form of a polynomial is
%
%      P(X) = A1 + A2*X + A3*X^2 + ... + (AN+1)*X^N
%
%    The Taylor expansion at C has the form
%
%      P(X) = A1 + A2*(X-C) + A3*(X-C)^2 + ... + (AN+1)*(X-C)^N
%
%    The factorial form of a polynomial is
%
%      P(X) = A1 + A2*X + A3*(X)*(X-1) + A4*(X)*(X-1)*(X-2)+...
%        + (AN+1)*(X)*(X-1)*...*(X-N+1)

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the number of coefficients in the polynomial
%    (in other words, the polynomial degree + 1)
%
%    integer A(N), the coefficients of the polynomial.
%
%    integer X0, for IOPT = -1, 0, or positive, the value of the
%    argument at which the polynomial is to be evaluated, or the
%    Taylor expansion is to be carried out.
%
%    integer IOPT, a flag describing which algorithm is to
%    be carried out:
%    -3: Reverse Stirling.  Input the coefficients of the polynomial in
%    factorial form, output them in power sum form.
%    -2: Stirling.  Input the coefficients in power sum form, output them
%    in factorial form.
%    -1: Evaluate a polynomial which has been input in factorial form.
%    0:  Evaluate a polynomial input in power sum form.
%    1 or more:  Given the coefficients of a polynomial in
%    power sum form, compute the first IOPT coefficients of
%    the polynomial in Taylor expansion form.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer A(N), the coefficients of the output polynomial.
%    Depending on the option chosen, these coefficients are the input values,
%    or those of a different form of the polynomial.
%
%    integer VAL, for IOPT = -1 or 0, the value of the
%    polynomial at the point X0.
