%
%% thue_binary_next() returns the next element in a binary Thue sequence.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Thue demonstrated that arbitrarily long sequences of 0's and
%    1's could be generated which had the "cubefree" property.  In
%    other words, for a given string S, there was no substring W
%    such that S contained "WWW".  In fact, a stronger result holds:
%    if "a" is the first letter of W, it is never the case that S
%    contains the substring "WWa".
%
%    In this example, the digits allowed are binary, that is, just
%    "0" and "1".  The replacement rules are:
%
%    "0" -> "01"
%    "1" -> "10"
%
%    This routine produces the next binary Thue sequence in a given series.
%    However, the input sequence must be a Thue sequence in order for
%    us to guarantee that the output sequence will also have the
%    cubic nonrepetition property.
%
%    Also, enough space must be set aside in THUE to hold the
%    output sequence.  This will always be twice the input
%    value of N.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the length of the input sequence.
%
%    integer THUE(N), the initial Thue sequence.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer N, the length of the output sequence.
%
%    integer THUE(N), the result of applying the substitution rules once.
