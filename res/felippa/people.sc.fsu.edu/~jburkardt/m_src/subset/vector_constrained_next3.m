%
%% vector_constrained_next3() returns the "next" constrained vector.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    This routine addresses the same problem as VECTOR_CONSTRAINED_NEXT2,
%    and differs only in that real arithmetic is used, rather than
%    integer arithmetic.  Integer arithmetic allows us to do an exact
%    calculation, but we run into overflow problems in simple cases
%    where N is 10 and the X_MAX entries are of order 10, for instance.
%
%    We consider all vectors of dimension N whose components
%    satisfy X_MIN(1:N) <= X(1:N) <= X_MAX(1:N).
%
%    We are only interested in the subset of these vectors which
%    satisfy the following constraint:
%
%      sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) ( X(I) / X_MAX(I) ) <= 1
%
%  Example:
%
%    N = 3
%    X_MIN:   1   1   1
%    X_MAX:   5   6   4
%
%    P = 120
%
%    #  X(1)  X(2)  X(3)  CONSTRAINT
%
%    1    1     1     1      0.62
%    2    2     1     1      0.82
%    3    1     2     1      0.78
%    4    2     2     1      0.98
%    5    1     3     1      0.95
%    6    1     1     2      0.87

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the number of components in the vector.
%
%    integer X_MIN(N), X_MAX(N), the minimum and maximum
%    values allowed in each component.
%
%    integer X(N).  On first call (with MORE = FALSE),
%    the input value of X is not important.  On subsequent calls, the
%    input value of X should be the output value from the previous call.
%
%    logical MORE.  On input, if the user has set MORE
%    FALSE, the user is requesting the initiation of a new sequence
%    of values.  If MORE is TRUE, then the user is requesting "more"
%    values in the current sequence.  
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer X(N). On output, (with MORE = TRUE), the value of X will be the "next"
%    vector in the reverse lexicographical list of vectors that satisfy
%    the condition.  However, on output with MORE = FALSE, the vector
%    X is meaningless, because there are no more vectors in the list.
%
%    real CONSTRAINT, the constraint value for X.  
%    Valid vectors X will have a CONSTRAINT value between 
%      product(X_MIN(1:N)) / product(X_MAX(1:N))
%    and 1.0.
%
%    logical MORE.  On output, if MORE is TRUE,
%    then another value was found and returned in X, but if MORE is
%    FALSE, then there are no more values in the sequence, and X is
%    NOT the next value.
