%% ksub_next3() generates subsets of size K from a set of size N, one at a time.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the size of the set from which subsets are drawn.
%    N must be positive.
%
%    integer K, the size of the desired subsets.  K must be
%    between 0 and N.
%
%    integer A(K).  A(I) is the I-th element of the
%    output subset.  The elements of A are sorted.
%
%    logical MORE.  On first call, set MORE = FALSE
%    to signal the beginning.  MORE will be set to TRUE, and on
%    each call, the routine will return another K-subset.
%    Finally, when the last subset has been returned,
%    MORE will be set FALSE and you may stop calling.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer A(K).  A(I) is the I-th element of the
%    output subset.  The elements of A are sorted.
%
%    logical MORE.  On first call, set MORE = FALSE
%    to signal the beginning.  MORE will be set to TRUE, and on
%    each call, the routine will return another K-subset.
%    Finally, when the last subset has been returned,
%    MORE will be set FALSE and you may stop calling.
%
%    integer IN, the element of the output subset which
%    was not in the input set.  Each new subset differs from the
%    last one by adding one element and deleting another.  IN is not
%    defined the first time that the routine returns, and is
%    set to zero.
%
%    integer IOUT, the element of the input subset which is
%    not in the output subset.  IOUT is not defined the first time
%    the routine returns, and is set to zero.
