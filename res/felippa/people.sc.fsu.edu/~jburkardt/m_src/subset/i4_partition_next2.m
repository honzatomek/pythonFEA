%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% i4_partition_next2() computes the partitions of the integer N one at a time.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Unlike compositions, order is not important in a partition.  Thus
%    the sequences 3+2+1 and 1+2+3 represent distinct compositions, but
%    not distinct partitions.  Also 0 is never returned as one of the
%    elements of the partition.
%
%    Initialize the program by calling with MORE = FALSE.  On an initialization
%    call, the input values of A, MULT and NPART are not needed.  Thereafter,
%    they should be set to the output values of A, MULT and NPART
%    from the previous call.
%
%  Example:
%
%    Sample partitions of 6 include:
%
%      6 = 4+1+1 = 3+2+1 = 2+2+2

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the integer whose partitions are desired.
%
%    integer NPART, the output value of NPART on the previous call.
%
%    integer A(N), the output value of A on the previous call.
%
%    integer MULT(N), the output value of MULT on the previous call.
%
%    logical MORE, is FALSE on the first call, which causes
%    initialization.  Thereafter, it should be TRUE.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer NPART, the number of distinct, nonzero parts in the
%    output partition.
%
%    integer A(N).  A(1:NPART) the distinct parts
%    of the partition.
%
%    integer MULT(1:NPART), the multiplicity of the parts.
%
%    logical MORE is TRUE if there are more partitions available.
