%% i4mat_01_rowcolsum() creates a 0/1 matrix with given row and column sums.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Given an M vector R and N vector C, there may exist one or more
%    M by N matrices with entries that are 0 or 1, whose row sums are R
%    and column sums are C.
%
%    For convenience, this routine requires that the entries of R and C
%    be given in nonincreasing order.
%
%    There are several requirements on R and C.  The simple requirements
%    are that the entries of R and C must be nonnegative, that the entries
%    of R must each be no greater than N, and those of C no greater than M,
%    and that the sum of the entries of R must equal the sum of the entries 
%    of C.
%
%    The final technical requirement is that if we form R*, the conjugate
%    partition of R, then C is majorized by R*, that is, that every partial
%    sum from 1 to K of the entries of C is no bigger than the sum of the same
%    entries of R*, for every K from 1 to N.
%
%    Given these conditions on R and C, there is at least one 0/1 matrix
%    with the given row and column sums.
%
%    The conjugate partition of R is constructed as follows:
%      R*(1) is the number of entries of R that are 1 or greater.
%      R*(2) is the number of entries of R that are 2 or greater.
%      ...
%      R*(N) is the number of entries of R that are N (can't be greater).
%
%  Example:
%
%    M = N = 5
%    R = ( 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 )
%    C = ( 2, 2, 2, 2, 1 )
%
%    A =
%      1 0 1 0 1
%      1 0 0 1 0
%      0 1 0 1 0
%      0 1 0 0 0
%      0 0 1 0 0

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer M, N, the number of rows and columns in the array.
%
%    integer R(M), C(N), the row and column sums desired for the array.
%    Both vectors must be arranged in descending order.
%    The elements of R must be between 0 and N.
%    The elements of C must be between 0 and M.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer A(M,N), the M by N matrix with the given row and
%    column sums.
%    Each entry of A is 0 or 1.
%
%    integer IERROR, an error flag.
%    0, no error was encountered, and the array was computed.
%    1, R and C do not have the same total.
%    2, R is not monotone decreasing, or has illegal entries.
%    3, C is not monotone decreasing, or has illegal entries.
%    4, R and C are not a possible set of row and column sums.
%
