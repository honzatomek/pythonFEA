function x = josephus ( n, m, k )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% josephus() returns the position X of the K-th man to be executed.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The classic Josephus problem concerns a circle of 41 men.
%    Every third man is killed and removed from the circle.  Counting
%    and executing continues until all are dead.  Where was the last
%    survivor sitting?
%
%    Note that the first person killed was sitting in the third position.
%    Moreover, when we get down to 2 people, and we need to count the
%    "third" one, we just do the obvious thing, which is to keep counting
%    around the circle until our count is completed.
%
%    The process may be regarded as generating a permutation of
%    the integers from 1 to N.  The permutation would be the execution
%    list, that is, the list of the executed men, by position number.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the number of men.
%    N must be positive.
%
%    integer M, the counting index.
%    M must not be zero.  Ordinarily, M is positive, and no greater than N.
%
%    integer K, the index of the executed man of interest.
%    K must be between 1 and N.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer X, the position of the K-th man.
%    X will be between 1 and N.

%  In case M is bigger than N, or negative, get the
%  equivalent positive value between 1 and N.
%  You can skip this operation if 1 <= M <= N.
