      <b>tetrahedron_slice_display</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      displays the intersection of a tetrahedron with a plane.
    </p>

    <p>
     The intersection of a plane and a tetrahedron is a convex
     planar polygon which is bounded by 0 to 4 points.  The possibilities are:
     <ul>
       <li>
         0) empty (no intersection);
       </li>
       <li>
         1) a single point;
       </li>
       <li>
         2) a single line segment;
       </li>
       <li>
         3) a triangle;
       </li>
       <li>
         4) a quadrilateral.
       </li>
     </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Given the data, the program displays a wireframe image of the
      tetrahedron, the points of intersection, and the convex polygon.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user defines the tetrahedron by giving a 3x4 vertex array <b>T</b>
      containing the XYZ coordinates of the vertices.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user defines the plane using the <i>normal form</i>.  That is,
      the user gives a single point <b>P</b> which lies on the plane,
      and a vector <b>NORMAL</b> which defines the direction normal to the plane.
