    <p>
      <b>sparse_grid_hw</b>,
      a MATLAB code which 
      can compute sparse grids for multidimensional integration,
      based on 1D rules for the unit interval with unit weight function,
      or for the real line with the Gauss-Hermite weight function.
      The original version of the code is by Florian Heiss and Viktor Winschel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original version of this software, and other information,
      is available at <a href = "https://sparse-grids.de/">
                                 https://sparse-grids.de </a>.

    <p>
      Four built-in 1D families of quadrature rules are supplied, and the
      user can extend the package by supplying any family of 1D quadrature
      rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      The built-in families are identified by a 3-letter key which is also
      the name of the MATLAB function that returns members of the family:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>gqu</b>, standard Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules, for
          the unit interval [0,1], with weight function w(x) = 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>gqn</b>, standard Gauss-Hermite quadrature rules, for
          the infinite interval (-oo,+oo), with weight function 
          w(x) = exp(-x*x/2)/sqrt(2*pi).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>kpu</b>, Kronrod-Patterson quadrature rules, for
          the unit interval [0,1], with weight function w(x) = 1.
          These sacrifice some of the precision of <b>gqu</b> in
          order to provide a family of nested rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>kpn</b>, Kronrod-Patterson quadrature rules, for
          the infinite interval (-oo,+oo), with weight function 
          w(x) = exp(-x*x/2)/sqrt(2*pi).
          These sacrifice some of the precision of <b>gqn</b> in
          order to provide a family of nested rules.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The user can build new sparse grids by supplying a 1D quadrature family.
      Examples provided include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>ccu</b>, Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules, for
          the unit interval [0,1], with weight function w(x) = 1.
          The K-th call returns the rule of order 1
          if K is 1, and 2*(K-1)+1 otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ccs</b>, slow Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules, for
          the unit interval [0,1], with weight function w(x) = 1.
          The K-th call returns the rule of order 1
          if K is 1, and otherwise a rule whose order N has the
          form 2^E+1 and is the lowest such order with precision at least 2*K-1.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>glo</b>, Gauss-Legendre odd quadrature rules, for
          the unit interval [0,1], with weight function w(x) = 1.
          The K-th call returns the rule of order 2*(K/2)+1.
        </li>
      </ul>
