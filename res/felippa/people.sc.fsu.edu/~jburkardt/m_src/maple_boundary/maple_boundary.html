      <b>maple_boundary</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      takes an image of a maple leaf and determines the pixels that form
      the boundary.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a discussion of quasirandom sampling, Brian Hayes published a 
      picture of a maple leaf and considered how its area could be
      estimated using a regular grid of points, random sampling, or
      quasirandom sampling.
    </p>

    <p>
      For various reasons, it will be interesting to have a copy of this
      maple leaf image accessible.  The MAPLE_BOUNDARY functions use various
      MATLAB procedures to turn the maple leaf image into a polygonal
      curve definining the boundary, following which various calculations
      may be made.
