      <b>human_data</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      displays an image of an outline of a human body,
      saves points along the boundary that are selected by user clicks,
      and writes this data to a file.  The file can be used to
      define a region, which can be triangulated and analyzed by 
      the finite element method (FEM).
