      <b>ball_and_stick_display</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      makes a 3D "ball and stick" plot.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB has many procedures for displaying numeric data in 3D using contours,
      vector plots, surfaces and so on.  However, sometimes an illustrator needs
      to construct a simple 3D image of points and lines.  Since the thing has
      to show up as an illustration or a slide, the points are exaggerated to
      balls, and the lines to sticks.
    </p>

    <p>
      MATLAB's <b>plot3</b> command can create both kinds of objects, but
      it helps to know how to specify the desired object properties for
      color and size.  The MATLAB help system is not very helpful when trying
      to find out what properties you can specify and what values they can have.
    </p>

    <p>
      So this program may be a helpful example of how a 3D object can be
      created with knobby balls and colored sticks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The particular object created here is intended to illustrate the
      Lax-Wendroff scheme for approximating the solution of a hyperbolic
      partial differential equation.  The blue spheres represent points at
      which data is known.  The green spheres represent points at which
      fluxes are estimated by computing differences between neighboring values.
      The red sphere is the locationi of the updated solution value.
