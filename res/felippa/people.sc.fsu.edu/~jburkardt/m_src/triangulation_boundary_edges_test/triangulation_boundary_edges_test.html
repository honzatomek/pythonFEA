      <b>triangulation_boundary_edges_test</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      calls triangulation_boundary_edges(), which
      analyzes the triangulation of a region, identify the edges that
      form the boundaries, organize the boundary edges into one or more
      connected components, and write a file describing the components
      and the sequence of boundary edges.
