    <p>
      <b>pyramid_rule</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      generates a quadrature rule 
      over the interior of the unit pyramid in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quadrature rules generated by <b>PYRAMID_RULE</b> are all
      examples of <i>conical product rules</i>, and involve a kind of
      direct product of the form:
      <blockquote>
        Legendre rule in X * Legendre rule in Y * Jacobi rule in Z
      </blockquote>
      where the Jacobi rule includes a factor of (1-Z)^2.
    </p>

    <p>
       The integration region is:
       <pre>
       - ( 1 - Z ) <= X <= 1 - Z
       - ( 1 - Z ) <= Y <= 1 - Z
                 0 <= Z <= 1.
       </pre>
       When Z is zero, the integration region is a square lying in the (X,Y) 
       plane, centered at (0,0,0) with "radius" 1.  As Z increases to 1, the 
       radius of the square diminishes, and when Z reaches 1, the square has 
       contracted to the single point (0,0,1).

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>pyramid_rule</b> ( <i>legendre_order</i>, <i>jacobi_order</I>, <i>'filename'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>legendre_order</i> is the order of the 1D Legendre quadrature rule
          to be used.  The X and Y dimensions will use a product of this rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>jacobi_order</i> is the order of the 1D Jacobi quadrature rule to
          be used.  The Z dimension will use this rule which will include a 
          factor of (1-X)^2 which accounts for the narrowing of the pyramid.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'filename'</i> is the common prefix for the files containing the region, weight
          and abscissa information of the quadrature rule;
        </li>
      </ul>
