    <p>
      <b>triangulation_order3_contour</b>,
      a MATLAB code which 
      reads datafiles describing a set of nodes, their triangulation, and the
      value of a scalar quantity at each node, and creates a color
      contour plot of the scalar.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program reads three data files:
      <ul>
        <li>
          a node file, containing 
          X, Y coordinates of points;
        </li>
        <li>
          an element file, 
          containing a list of sets of three points making up each 
          triangular element;  (if this file does not exist, the
          program will generate the element data automatically).
        </li>
        <li>
          a values file, 
          containing the values of a scalar function U(X,Y) evaluated
          at each node.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program automatically displays three plots:
      <ol>
        <li>
          An line drawing of the triangulation;
        </li>
        <li>
          A color contour plot with color constant over a triangle.
        </li>
        <li>
          A color contour plot with color linearly interpolated to make
          a very nice picture.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

          <i>'prefix'</i>_elements.txt lists the indices of nodes that form elements
          (this file is optional, and if not supplied, the information will
