      <b>distmesh_3d</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      generates and manipulates unstructured meshes
      in 3D, by Per-Olof Persson.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is relatively simple, and
      the user is able to define a variety of geometric shapes,
      and desired mesh densities.
    </p>

    <p>
      DISTMESH_3D is, pretty much, simply the subset of
      Persson and Strang's DISTMESH package that works on
      3D problems.
