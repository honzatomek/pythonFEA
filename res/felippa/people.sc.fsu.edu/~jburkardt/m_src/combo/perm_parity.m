function parity = perm_parity ( n, p )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% perm_parity() computes the parity of a permutation.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The routine requires the use of a temporary array.
%
%    A permutation is called "even" or "odd", depending on whether
%    it is equivalent to an even or odd number of pairwise 
%    transpositions.  This is known as the "parity" of the 
%    permutation.
%
%    The "sign" of a permutation is +1 if it has even parity,
%    and -1 if it has odd parity.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the number of values being permuted.
%    N must be positive.
%
%    integer P(N), describes the permutation.
%    P(I) is the item which is permuted into the I-th place
%    by the permutation.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer PARITY, the parity of the permutation.
%    0, the permutation has even parity.
%    1, the permutation has odd parity.
