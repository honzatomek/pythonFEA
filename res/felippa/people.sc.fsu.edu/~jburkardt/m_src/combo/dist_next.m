%% dist_next() returns the next distribution of indistinguishable objects.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    A distribution of M objects into K parts is an ordered sequence
%    of K nonnegative integers which sum to M.  This is similar to
%    a partition of a set into K subsets, except that here the order
%    matters.  That is, (1,1,2) and (1,2,1) are considered to be
%    different distributions.
%
%    On the first call to this routine, the user should set MORE = FALSE,
%    to signal that this is a startup for the given computation.  The routine
%    will return the first distribution, and set MORE = TRUE.
%
%    If the user calls again, with MORE = TRUE, the next distribution
%    is being requested.  If the routine returns with MORE = TRUE, then
%    that distribution was found and returned.  However, if the routine
%    returns with MORE = FALSE, then no more distributions were found;
%    the enumeration of distributions has terminated.
%
%    A "distribution of M indistinguishable objects into K slots" is
%    sometimes called a "composition of the integer M into K parts".
%
%  Example:
%
%    K = 3, M = 5
%
%    0           0           5
%    0           1           4
%    0           2           3
%    0           3           2
%    0           4           1
%    0           5           0
%    1           0           4
%    1           1           3
%    1           2           2
%    1           3           1
%    1           4           0
%    2           0           3
%    2           1           2
%    2           2           1
%    2           3           0
%    3           0           2
%    3           1           1
%    3           2           0
%    4           0           1
%    4           1           0
