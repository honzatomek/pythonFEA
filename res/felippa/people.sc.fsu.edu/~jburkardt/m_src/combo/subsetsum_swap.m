function [ a, index, sum_achieved ] = subsetsum_swap ( n, a, sum_desired )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% subsetsum_swap() seeks a solution of the subset sum problem by swapping.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Given a collection of N not necessarily distinct positive integers A(I),
%    and a positive integer SUM_DESIRED, select a subset of the values so that
%    their sum is as close as possible to SUM_DESIRED without exceeding it.
%
%  Algorithm:
%
%    Start with no values selected, and SUM_ACHIEVED = 0.
%
%    Consider each element A(I):
%
%      If A(I) is not selected and SUM_ACHIEVED + A(I) <= SUM_DESIRED,
%        select A(I).
%
%      If A(I) is still not selected, and there is a selected A(J)
%      such that SUM_GOT < SUM_ACHIEVED + A(I) - A(J),
%        select A(I) and deselect A(J).
%
%      If no items were selected on this sweep,
%        exit.
%      Otherwise,
%        repeat the search.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the number of values.  N must be positive.
%
%    integer A(N), a collection of positive values.
%
%    integer SUM_DESIRED, the desired sum.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer A(N), A has been sorted into descending order.
%
%    integer INDEX(N); INDEX(I) is 1 if A(I) is part of the
%    sum, and 0 otherwise.
%
%    integer SUM_ACHIEVED, the sum of the selected elements.
%

%
%  Initialize.
%
  sum_achieved = 0;
  index(1:n) = 0;
%
%  Sort into descending order.
