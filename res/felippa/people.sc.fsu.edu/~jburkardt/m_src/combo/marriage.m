%% marriage() finds a stable set of marriages for given preferences.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Given a set of N men and N women who must be married in pairs,
%    and information defining the relative rankings that each person
%    assigns to the candidates of the opposite sex, this routine finds
%    a stable set of marriages for them.
%
%    A stable set of marriages is a pairing of the men and women with
%    the stability property: if M1 marries W1 and M2 marries W2, then
%    it is never the case that M1 and W2 would both prefer to be married
%    to each other.
%
%    An important application of stable marriage algorithms occurs in
%    the annual matching of medical residents to hospitals.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the number of pairs of men and women.
%
%    integer PREFER(N,N); for man I, the value of
%    PREFER(I,J) represents his J-th preference for a wife.
%
%    integer RANK(N,N); for woman I, the value of RANK(I,J)
%    represents her ranking of man number J.  A value of 1 for RANK(I,J)
%    means woman I ranks man J most preferable, while a value of N
%    would mean she ranked him least preferable.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer FIANCEE(N); for woman I, FIANCEE(I) is the
%    man to whom she is now engaged.
%
%    integer NEXT(N); for man I, NEXT(I) is his preference
%    ranking for the woman to whom he is now engaged.  A value of 1 represents
%    his first choice, a value of N his last.
%

%
%  For man I, NEXT(I) is the woman I has most recently proposed to,
%  and hence NEXT(I)+1 is the next one to try.
%
  next(1:n) = 0;
%
%  For woman I, FIANCEE(I) is the man she has agree to marry,
%  or 0 if she has not agreed to any man yet.
%
  fiancee(1:n) = 0;
%
%  Start with an unengaged man, and end with an engaged woman.
%
  for i = 1 : n

    m = i;

    while ( true )

      next(m) = next(m) + 1;
