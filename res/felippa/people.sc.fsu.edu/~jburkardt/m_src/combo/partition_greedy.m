%
%% partition_greedy() attacks the partition problem with a greedy algorithm.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Given a collection of N not necessarily distinct positive integers A(I),
%    it is desired to partition the values into two groups, whose sums are
%    as close as possible.
%
%  Algorithm:
%
%    Begin with sets 1 and 2 empty.
%
%    Process the data in descending order of magnitude.
%
%    The next item A(I) is added to set 1 or set 2, whichever has the
%    smallest current sum.
%
%    Stop as soon as all items have been allocated.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the number of values.  N must be positive.
%
%    integer A(N), a collection of positive values.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer A(N), A has been sorted into descending order.
%
%    integer INDX(N); INDX(I) is 1 if A(I) is part of
%    set 1, and 2 if it is assigned to set 2.
