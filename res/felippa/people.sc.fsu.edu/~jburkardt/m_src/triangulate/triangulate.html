    <p>
      <b>triangulate</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      triangulates a polygon.
    </p>

    <p>
      The polygon is defined by an input file which gives the coordinates
      of the vertices of the polygon, in counterclockwise order.
    </p>

    <p>
      No consecutive pair of vertices should be equal; when describing a
      polygon, sometimes the first and last vertices are equal.  For this
      program, that is not the case.  To describe a square, your input
      file should contain four pairs of coordinates, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vertices should be listed in counterclockwise order.  If you list
      them in clockwise order, then the area will probably come out negative.
      The program will retry the calculation by reversing the order of the
      vertices.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible to create a "polygon" that has zero area.  The program
      will refuse to process such an object.
    </p>

    <p>
      The polygon does not need to be convex.  However, you should be careful
      not to specify a polygon which crosses itself, since this means the
      interior of the polygon is not well defined, and hence a triangulation
      is not well defined.  As a simple example of such a problem, consider
      the four vertices of a square in counterclockwise order: V1, V2, V3, V4,
      and list them instead as V1, V3, V2, V4.  This shape cannot be triangulated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The output of the program is a list of the "diagonal lines"
      defined by pairs of vertices which constitute the triangulation,
      a list of the nodes that form the triangles of the triangulation,
      and an image of the triangulated polygon.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is based on a C program by Joseph ORourke.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i><b>_diagonals.txt</b> listing N-3 pairs of vertices that
          form the internal diagonals of the triangulation.
