%% polygon_solid_angle_3d(): projected solid angle of a 3D plane polygon.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    A point P is at the center of a unit sphere.  A planar polygon
%    is to be projected onto the surface of this sphere, by drawing
%    the ray from P to each polygonal vertex, and noting where this ray
%    intersects the sphere.
%
%    We compute the area on the sphere of the projected polygon.
%
%    Since we are projecting the polygon onto a unit sphere, the area 
%    of the projected polygon is equal to the solid angle subtended by 
%    the polygon.
%
%    The value returned by this routine will include a sign.  The
%    angle subtended will be NEGATIVE if the normal vector defined by
%    the polygon points AWAY from the viewing point, and will be
%    POSITIVE if the normal vector points towards the viewing point.
%
%    If the orientation of the polygon is of no interest to you,
%    then you can probably simply take the absolute value of the
%    solid angle as the information you want.
%
%    When vectors are employed in this function, they are required to
%    be column vectors, not row vectors.
