      <b>hypersphere</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      carries out various operations for an M-dimensional hypersphere, including 
      converting between Cartesian and spherical coordinates, 
      stereographic projection, sampling the surface of the sphere, and
      computing the surface area and volume.

      hypersphere_angle</a>,
      a MATLAB code which 
      considers the problem of describing the typical value of the angle
      between a pair of points randomly selected on the unit hypersphere
      in M dimensions.  Since by symmetry, this will be zero, we instead look
      at the average of the absolute value of the dot product, and the
      corresponding angle.  This starts out at 1 for dimension 1, and
      rapidly decreases as the spatial dimension increases.
