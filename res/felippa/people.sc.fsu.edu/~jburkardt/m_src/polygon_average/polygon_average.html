      <b>polygon_average</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      demonstrates a process of repeatedly averaging and normalizing the
      vertices of a polygon, illustrating a property of the power method.
    </p>

    <p>
      The process can be analyzed in terms of the power method, and the
      eigenvalues of the matrix that carries out the averaging process.
    </p>

    <p>
      A polygon is represented by a list of N vertices.  An averaging step 
      involves:
      <ul>
        <li>
          replacing each vertex by the average of its two neighbors, 
        </li>
        <li>
          shifting these vertices to have centroid 0;
        </li>
        <li>
          scaling the X and Y coordinates separately so that the max-norms
          of the X and Y coordinate vectors are both 1.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If the averaging process is carried out recursively, the resulting
      polygon rapidly converges to an ellipse at a 45 degree tilt.
    </p>

    <p>
      The direction of the tilt, and the ratio between the major and minor
      axis lengths, vary depending on the initial polygon.
