      <b>distance_to_position_sphere</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      estimates the positions of cities given a city-to-city distance table.
      The cities are presumed to lie on a sphere, and to be sufficiently
      separated that the curvature of the sphere must be accounted for.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is singular.  In particular, the position of one
      city is completely arbitrary, and one component of a second city is
      completely arbitrary (and a third city's position can be "flipped"
      about the line connecting cities one and two).  To remove some of this
      singularity, the program assigns city #1 to have latitude and longitude 0,
      and city #2 is given a longitude of 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the nonlinear least squares problem is set up, MATLAB's
      LSQNONLIN function is called to seek a solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that if the cities are all in a relatively small area, it may
      be reasonable to treat the problem as though it were posed on a plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your data is on the earth, note that the average radius of the earth
      is 3,959 miles or 6,371 kilometers.

      The selection of MATLAB's LSQNONLIN function for use as the solver,
      the construction of the appropriate anonymous function, and the setting
      of the options for LSQNONLIN were devised by Gene Cliff, to whom grateful
      acknowledgement is made.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>distance_to_position_sphere</b> ( <i>'distance.txt'</i>, <i>radius</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'distance.txt'</i> contains the distance table
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'radius'</i> is the radius of the sphere
        </li>
      </ul>
      reads the distance information in <i>'distance.txt'</i>, and the radius of the
      sphere, estimates the positions of the cities, and writes out a table of
      XYZ coordinates in <i>distance.xyz.txt</i> and Latitude/Longitude in
      <i>distance.latlon.txt</i>.
