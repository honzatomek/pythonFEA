    <p>
      <b>histogram_pdf_sample</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      demonstrates how sampling can be done by starting with the
      formula for a PDF, creating a histogram, constructing a
      histogram for the CDF, and then sampling.
    </p>

    <p>
      We would prefer to compute the CDF exactly by integration
      of the PDF, then invert the formula for the CDF to get a
      formula for random samples.  But often the CDF is not invertible,
      and often it's not possible to get an exact formula for the
      CDF in any case.  For such problems, the histogram approach 
      may provide a relatively straightforward solution.
