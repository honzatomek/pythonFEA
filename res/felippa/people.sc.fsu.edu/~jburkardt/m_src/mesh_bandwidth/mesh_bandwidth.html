    <p>
      <b>mesh_bandwidth</b>,
      a MATLAB code which 
      computes the geometric bandwidth of a mesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user specifies an element file, containing the indices of the
      nodes that make up each element.  Examples of such a file include
      the order 3 and order 6 triangulation files, but any order of element
      may be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not only may any element type be used, but the geometric region
      may be of any spatial dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program reads the element information and computes the
      geometric bandwidth <b>M</b> as
      <blockquote><b>
        M = ML + 1 + MU
      </b></blockquote>
      where <b>ML</b> is the lower bandwidth, namely, the maximum value
      over all nodes <b>I</b> of the difference <b>(I-J)</b>, taken over
      all nodes <b>J</b> that share an element with node <b>I</b>.
      The upper bandwidth is the maximum value of <b>(J-I)</b> under
      the same conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The geometric bandwidth <b>M</b> is the linear algebraic bandwidth
      of the adjacency matrix of the mesh, where <b>I</b> and <b>J</b>
      are considered to be adjacent if there is some element that includes
      both nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The geometric bandwidth is of interest since it is the bandwidth
      of the finite element matrix associated with the mesh, when a
      scalar quantity is being approximated and there is a single
      unknown for every node, and the unknowns have the same numbering
      as the nodes.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>mesh_bandwidth</b> ( <i>'element_file'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'element_file'</i> contains a list of sets of node indices;
          each set of node indices describes a single element.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The program reads the element file and prints out the geometric 
      mesh bandwidth.
