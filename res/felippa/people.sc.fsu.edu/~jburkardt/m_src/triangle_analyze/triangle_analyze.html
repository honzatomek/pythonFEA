    <p>
      <b>triangle_analyze</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      reads a triangle defined in a file, and uses the TRIANGLE_PROPERTIES library to
      compute angles, area, centroid, circumcircle, edge lengths, incircle, orientation, 
      orthocenter, and quality.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangle_analyze</b> ( <i>'filename'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'filename'</i> is a file which contains the vertex coordinates.
        </li>
