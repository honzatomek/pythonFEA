      <b>hand_mesh2d</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      reads in points which outline a human hand,
      and calls mesh2d(), which creates a fine triangular
      mesh of the region outlined by the points.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original proposer of the hand data exercise was Cleve Moler, in the
      textbook <i>Numerical Computing with MATLAB</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      MESH2D is a powerful and easy-to-use program, by Darren Engwirda,
      for creating a good quality mesh of a region when the polygonal 
      outline of its boundary is given.
    </p>

    <p>
      The point of this exercise is simply to emphasize that a fairly
      general shape region can easily be triangulated, requiring little
      work from the user.
