      <b>distmesh</b>,
      a MATLAB code which generates
      and manipulates unstructured meshes in 2D, 3D and general ND,
      by Per-Olof Persson.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is relatively simple, and the user is able to define
      a variety of geometric shapes, and desired mesh densities.
    </p>

    <p>
      DISTMESH can be a very quick and flexible means of computing
      a set of points in a region.  However, keep in mind the following
      considerations:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Especially if you are have specified some fixed points which
          must appear in the mesh, it is possible for DISTMESH
          to return multiple instances of the same point.  For finite
          element applications, in particular, this can result in
          catastrophe.  The program <b>TABLE_MERGE</b> can fix this.
        </li>
        <li>
          The nodes produced by DISTMESH are not ordered or sorted
          in any way whatsoever.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because the nodes are not ordered in any way, the triangular
          elements produced by DISTMESH will typically contain
          nodes with widely ranging indices.  For finite element
          applications, this can result in a system matrix with an
          unnecessarily high bandwidth.  The program
          TRIANGULATION_RCM can fix this, after the fact.
        </li>
        <li>
          The triangles produced by DISTMESH are not necessarily
          oriented; they are just as likely to have positive or negative
          orientation.  Some finite element programs insist that all
          triangles have positive orientation.  The program
          TRIANGULATION_ORIENT can fix this, after the fact.
        </li>
        <li>
          When DISTMESH is trying to approximate a boundary, particularly
          a long straight boundary, it is possible for several points
          that really belong on the boundary to be slightly out of line.
          This means that they will be used to form a triangle, of
          very small area, and terrible conditioning.  This can result
          in perplexing problems near the boundary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because DISTMESH uses tolerances, it is possible for
          some nodes to lie outside the boundary of the region; it is
          possible for some triangles on the boundary to lie partially
          outside the region; it is possible for triangles that lie
          partly on the boundary, but entirely within the region, to
          be deleted, leaving a triangular hole.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you have the mesh, you may want to know which nodes lie
          on the boundary.  You'll want this information, for instance, if
          you need to impose boundary conditions on such nodes.  You may
          get a list of the boundary nodes using the program
          TRIANGULATION_BOUNDARY_NODES.
        </li>
      </ul>
