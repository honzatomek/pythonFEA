    <p>
      <b>triangle_display</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      plots a triangulation using files associated with 
      Jonathan Shewchuk's triangle() program.
    </p>

    <p>
      TRIANGLE_DISPLAY reads the node and element files created by
      the TRIANGLE program, and displays the information.  The user controls
      how "visible" the nodes and elements are; in particular, nodes can be
      suppressed, or displayed, or displayed and numbered, and the same is
      true for elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGLE_DISPLAY</b> is essentially a version of
      TRIANGULATION_DISPLAY modified to read input files that use
      the TRIANGLE format.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jonathan Shewchuk provides a program called showme(), which
      is able to show the same information, and to perform other interesting
      operations.  However, there are at least three reasons why the
      TRIANGLE_DISPLAY program is useful:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the user is free to zoom interactively into any part of the mesh
          displayed by TRIANGLE_DISPLAY;
        </li>
        <li>
          the user can save the image (or the portion that has been zoomed)
          into a wide variety of graphic formats, include JPEG, PNG and TIFF,
          while showme() is restriced to PS and EPS formats;
          moreover if showme() tries to save a snapshot of a large file
          (such as "greenland"), it can take 20 minutes (after which I gave up)
          and a huge amount of space.  The same image was generated in
          20 seconds with this program, and a zoomed image saved to a
          small 50K file very quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          it is fairly easy to modify the text of TRIANGLE_DISPLAY()
          to better suit the user's needs; in particular, it is easy
          to read in node-based data and produce contour plots (although
          I don't have any data to work with yet.)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangle_display</b> ( <i>'prefix'</i>, <i>node_vis</i>, <i>element_vis</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where <i>'prefix'</i> is the common prefix for the node and element files.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i><b>.node</b>,    the node coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i><b>.ele</b>,    the elements
        </li>
      </ul>
      and <i>node_vis</i> is an integer defining the node visibility:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>0</b>, do not show the nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1</b>, show the nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2</b>, show the nodes and label them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      and <i>element_vis</i> is an integer defining the element visibility:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>0</b>, do not show the elements;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1</b>, show the elements;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>2</b>, show the elements and color them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>3</b>, show the elements and color them, and label them.
        </li>
      </ul>
