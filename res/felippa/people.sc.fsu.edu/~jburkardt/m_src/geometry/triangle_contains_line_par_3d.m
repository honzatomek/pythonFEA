%% triangle_contains_line_par_3d(): finds if a line is inside a triangle in 3D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    A line will "intersect" the plane of a triangle in 3D if
%    * the line does not lie in the plane of the triangle
%      (there would be infinitely many intersections), AND
%    * the line does not lie parallel to the plane of the triangle
%      (there are no intersections at all).
%
%    Therefore, if a line intersects the plane of a triangle, it does so
%    at a single point.  We say the line is "inside" the triangle if,
%    regarded as 2D objects, the intersection point of the line and the plane
%    is inside the triangle.
%
%    A triangle in 3D is determined by three points:
%
%      T(1:3,1), T(1:3,2) and T(1:3,3).
%
%    The parametric form of a line in 3D is:
%
%      P(1:3) = P0(1:3) + PD(1:3) * T
%
%    We can normalize by requiring PD to have euclidean norm 1,
%    and the first nonzero entry positive.

%
%  Input:
%
%    real T(3,3), the three points that define
%    the triangle.
%
%    real P0(3,1), PD(3,1), parameters that define the
%    parametric line.
%
%  Output:
%
%    logical INSIDE, is TRUE if (the intersection point of)
%    the line is inside the triangle.
%
%    real P(3,1), is the point of intersection of the line
%    and the plane of the triangle, unless they are parallel.
