%% string_2d() groups line segments into connected lines in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The routine receives an unordered set of line segments, described by
%    pairs of coordinates (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2), and tries to group them
%    into ordered lists that constitute connected jagged lines.
%
%    This routine will not match two endpoints unless they are exactly equal.
%
%    On line segment I has endpoints ( X1VEC(I), Y1VEC(I) )
%    and ( X2VEC(I), Y2VEC(I) ).
%
%    On output, the order of the components may have been
%    switched.  That is, for some I, ( X1VEC(I), Y1VEC(I) ) and
%    ( X2VEC(I), Y2VEC(I) ) may have been swapped.
%
%    More importantly, all the entries X1VEC(I), Y1VEC(I),
%    Y1VEC(I) and Y2VEC(I) may have been swapped with another index J.
%
%    The resulting coordinates will have been sorted in order
%    of the string to which they belong, and then by the order
%    of their traversal within that string.
%
%    The array STRING(I) identifies the string to which segment I belongs.
%
%    If two segments I and J have the same value of STRING, then
%    ORDER(I) and ORDER(J) give the relative order of the two segments 
%    in the string.  Thus if ORDER(I) = -3 and ORDER(J) = 2, then when 
%    the string is traversed, segment I is traversed first, then four other
%    segments are traversed, and then segment J is traversed.
%
%    For each string, the segment with ORDER(I) = 0 is the initial segment 
%    from which the entire string was "grown" (with growth possible to both the
%    left and the right).
