%% triangle_circumcenter_2() computes the circumcenter of a triangle.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The circumcenter of a triangle is the center of the circumcircle, the
%    circle that passes through the three vertices of the triangle.
%
%    The circumcircle contains the triangle, but it is not necessarily the
%    smallest triangle to do so.
%
%    If all angles of the triangle are no greater than 90 degrees, then
%    the center of the circumscribed circle will lie inside the triangle.
%    Otherwise, the center will lie outside the triangle.
%
%    The circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors
%    of the sides of the triangle.
%
%    Surprisingly, the diameter of the circle can be found by solving
%    a 2 by 2 linear system.  If we label the vertices of the triangle
%    P1, P2 and P3, then the vectors P2 - P1 and P3 - P1 are secants of
%    the circle, and each forms a right triangle with the diameter.
%    Hence, the dot product of P2 - P1 with the diameter vector is equal
%    to the square of the length of P2 - P1, and similarly for P3 - P1.
%    This determines the diameter vector originating at P1.
%
%    In geometry, the circumcenter of a triangle is often symbolized by "O".
