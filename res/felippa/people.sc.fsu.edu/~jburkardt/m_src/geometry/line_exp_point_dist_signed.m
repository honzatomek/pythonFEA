%% line_exp_point_dist_signed(): signed distance ( explicit line, point ).
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The explicit form of a line in 2D is:
%
%      ( P1, P2 ) = ( (X1,Y1), (X2,Y2) ).
%
%    The signed distance has two interesting properties:
%
%    *  The absolute value of the signed distance is the
%        usual (Euclidean) distance.
%
%    *  Points with signed distance 0 lie on the line,
%       points with a negative signed distance lie on one side
%         of the line,
%       points with a positive signed distance lie on the
%         other side of the line.
%
%    Assuming that C is nonnegative, then if a point is a positive
%    distance away from the line, it is on the same side of the
%    line as the point (0,0), and if it is a negative distance
%    from the line, it is on the opposite side from (0,0).

%
%  Input:
%
%    real P1(2,1), P2(2,1), two points on the line.
%
%    real P(2,1), the point whose signed distance is desired.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real DIST_SIGNED, the signed distance from the
%    point to the line.
%

%
%  If the explicit line degenerates to a point, the computation is easy.
%
  if ( p1(1:2,1) == p2(1:2,1) )

    dist_signed = sqrt ( sum ( ( p1(1:2,1) - p(1:2,1) ).^2 ) );
%
%  Convert the explicit line to the implicit form A * X + B * Y + C = 0.
%  This makes the computation of the signed distance  to (X,Y) easy.
