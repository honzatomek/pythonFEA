%% circle_pppr2imp_3d() converts a circle from PPR to implicit form in 3D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The PPPR form of a circle in 3D is:
%
%      The circle of radius R passing through points P1 and P2,
%      and lying in the plane of P1, P2 and P3.
%
%    The implicit form of a circle in 3D is:
%
%      ( P(1) - PC(1) )^2 + ( P(2) - PC(2) )^2 + ( P(3) - PC(3) )^2 = R^2
%      and the dot product of P - PC with NORMAL is 0.
%
%    There may be zero, one, or two circles that satisfy the
%    requirements of the PPPR form.
%
%    If there is no such circle, then PC(1:2,1) and PC(1:2,2)
%    are set to the midpoint of (P1,P2).
%
%    If there is one circle, PC(1:2,1) and PC(1:2,2) will be equal.
%
%    If there are two circles, then PC(1:2,1) is the first center,
%    and PC(1:2,2) is the second.
%
%    This calculation is equivalent to finding the intersections of
%    spheres of radius R at points P1 and P2, which lie in the plane
%    defined by P1, P2 and P3.

%  Input:

%  Define a unit direction V that is normal to P2-P1, and lying

%
%  To do this, subtract from P3-P1 the component in the direction P2-P1.
