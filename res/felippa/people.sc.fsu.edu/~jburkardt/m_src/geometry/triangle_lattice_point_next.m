%% triangle_lattice_point_next() returns the next triangle lattice point.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The lattice triangle is defined by the vertices:
%
%      (0,0), (C(3)/C(1), 0) and (0,C(3)/C(2))
%
%    The lattice triangle is bounded by the lines
%
%      0 <= X,
%      0 <= Y
%      X / C(1) + Y / C(2) <= C(3)
%
%    Lattice points are listed one at a time, starting at the origin,
%    with X increasing first.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer C(3), coefficients defining the
%    lattice triangle.  These should be positive.
%
%    integer V(2).  On first call, the input
%    value is not important.  On a repeated call, the input value should
%    be the output value from the previous call.  
%
%    logical MORE.  On set MORE to FALSE to indicate
%    that this is the first call for a given triangle.  Thereafter, the input
%    value should be the output value from the previous call.  
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer V(2).  V contains
%    the next lattice point.
%
%    logical MORE. 
%    MORE is TRUE if the returned value V is a new lattice point.
%    If the output value is FALSE, then no more lattice points were found,
%    and V was reset to 0, and the routine should not be called further
%    for this triangle.
