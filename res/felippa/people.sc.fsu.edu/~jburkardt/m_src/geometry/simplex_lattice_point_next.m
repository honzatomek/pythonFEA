function [ v, more ] = simplex_lattice_point_next ( n, c, v, more )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% simplex_lattice_point_next() returns the next simplex lattice point.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The lattice simplex is defined by the vertices:
%
%      (0,0,...,0), (C(N+1)/C(1),0,...,0), (0,C(N+1)/C(2),...,0) ...
%      (0,0,...C(N+1)/C(N))
%
%    The lattice simplex is bounded by the lines
%
%      0 <= V(1:N),
%      V(1) / C(1) + V(2) / C(2) + ... + V(N) / C(N) <= C(N+1)
%
%    Lattice points are listed one at a time, starting at the origin,
%    with V(1) increasing first.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the spatial dimension.
%
%    integer C(N+1), coefficients defining the
%    lattice simplex.  These should be positive.
%
%    integer V(N).  On first call, the input
%    value is not important.  On a repeated call, the input value should
%    be the output value from the previous call. 
%
%    logical MORE.  On set MORE to FALSE to indicate
%    that this is the first call for a given simplex.  Thereafter, the input
%    value should be the output value from the previous call.  
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer V(N).  V contains
%    the next lattice point.
%
%    logical MORE.  MORE is TRUE if not only is the returned value V a lattice point,
%    but the routine can be called again for another lattice point.
%    If the output value is FALSE, then no more lattice points were found,
%    and V was reset to 0, and the routine should not be called further
%    for this simplex.
