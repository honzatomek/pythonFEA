%% circle_imp_point_dist_signed_2d(): signed distance ( implicit circle, point ) in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The signed distance is zero if the point is on the circle.
%    The signed distance is negative if the point is inside the circle.
%
%    An implicit circle in 2D satisfies the equation:
%
%      ( X - CENTER(1) )^2 + ( Y - CENTER(2) )^2 = R^2

%
%  Input:
%
%    real R, the radius of the circle.
%
%    real CENTER(2,1), the center of the circle.
%
%    real P(2,1), the point to be checked.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real DIST, the signed distance of the point
%    to the circle.  If the point is inside the circle, the signed distance
%    is negative.
