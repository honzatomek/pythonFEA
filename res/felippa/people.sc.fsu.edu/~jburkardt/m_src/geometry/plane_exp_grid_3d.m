%% plane_exp_grid_3d() computes points and lines making up a planar grid in 3D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The explicit form of a plane in 3D is:
%
%      the plane through P1, P2 and P3.
%
%    The data format used is that of SGI Inventor.
%
%    On input, if NCOR3 is zero (or negative), then the data computed by 
%    this routine will be stored normally in COR3.  But if NCOR3 is 
%    positive, it is assumed that COR3 already contains NCOR3 items
%    of useful data.  The new data is appended to COR3.  On output, NCOR3 
%    is increased by the number of points computed by this routine.
%
%    On input, if NLINE is zero (or negative), then the data computed by 
%    this routine will be stored normally in LINES.  But if NLINE is positive, 
%    it is assumed that LINES already contains some useful data.  The
%    new data is appended to LINES.  On output, NLINE is increased by the 
%    number of lines computed by this routine.

%
%  Input:
%
%    real P1(3), P2(3), P3(3), three points on the plane.
%
%    integer NCOR3, the number of points stored in COR3.
%
%    integer NLINE, the number of line data items.
%
%    real COR3(3,MAXCOR3), the grid points.
%
%    integer LINES(MAXLINE), the indices of points used in
%    the lines of the grid.  Successive entries of LINES are joined
%    by a line, unless an entry equals -1.  Note that indices begin
%    with 0.
%
%    integer MAXCOR3, the maximum number of points that can be
%    stored.
%
%    integer MAXLINE, the maximum number of line items that can
%    be stored.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer IERROR, error indicator.
%    0, no error.
%    1, more space for point coordinates is needed.
%    2, more space for line data is needed.
%
%    integer NCOR3, the number of points stored in COR3.
%
%    integer NLINE, the number of line data items.
%
%    real COR3(3,MAXCOR3), the grid points.
%
%    integer LINES(MAXLINE), the indices of points used in
%    the lines of the grid.  Successive entries of LINES are joined
%    by a line, unless an entry equals -1.  Note that indices begin
%    with 0.
