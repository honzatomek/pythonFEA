function inside = triangle_contains_point_2d_3 ( t, p )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% triangle_contains_point_2d_3() finds if a point is inside a triangle in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    This routine is the same as TRIANGLE_CONTAINS_POINT_2D_2, except
%    that it does not assume an ordering of the points.  It should
%    work correctly whether the vertices of the triangle are listed
%    in clockwise or counter clockwise order.
%
%    The routine determines if a point P is "to the right of" each of the lines
%    that bound the triangle.  It does this by computing the cross product
%    of vectors from a vertex to its next vertex, and to P.
%
%    The point is inside the triangle if it is to the right of all
%    the lines, or to the left of all the lines.
%
%    This version was suggested by Paulo Ernesto of Maptek Brasil.

%  Input:

%    real T(2,3), the triangle vertices.
%
%    real P(2,1), the point to be checked.
%
%  Output:
%
%    logical INSIDE, is TRUE if the point is inside
