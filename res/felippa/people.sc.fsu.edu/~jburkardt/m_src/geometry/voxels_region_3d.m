%% voxels_region_3d() arranges a set of voxels into contiguous regions in 3D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    On input, the ISHOW array contains zero and nonzero values.  The nonzero
%    values are taken to be active voxels.  On output, the zero voxels remain
%    zero, and all the active voxels have been assigned a value which now
%    indicates membership in a region, or group of contiguous voxels.
%
%    On output, the array LIST contains information about the regions.
%    The last used element of LIST is LIST_NUM.
%
%    The number of elements in region NREGION is NELEM = LIST(LIST_NUM).  
%    The (I,J,K) indices of the last element in this region are in
%    LIST(LIST_NUM-3) through LIST(LIST_NUM-1), and the first element is
%    listed in LIST(LIST_NUM-3*NELEM), LIST(LIST_NUM-3*NELEM+1),
%    LIST(LIST_NUM-3*NELEM+2).
%
%    The number of elements in NREGION-1 is listed in LIST(LIST_NUM-3*NELEM-1), 
%    and the (I,J,K) indices of the these elements are listed there.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer MAXLIST, the maximum length of the array used to
%    list the elements of the regions.
%
%    integer NX, NY, NZ, the number of voxels in the X, Y and
%    Z directions.
%
%    integer ISHOW(NX,NY,NZ), the only significance to
%    the entries is whether they are zero or nonzero.  
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer ISHOW(NX,NY,NZ), the nonzero entries have now been revalued 
%    so that contiguous entries have the same value, indicating a grouping into 
%    a region.
%
%    integer LIST_NUM, the number of entries of LIST that were used.
%    However, if MAXLIST < LIST_NUM, then there was not enough space in
%    LIST to store the data properly, and LIST should not be used,
%    although the data in ISHOW should be correct.
%
%    integer LIST(MAXLIST), contains, in stack form, a list
%    of the indices of the elements in each region.
%
%    integer NREGION, the number of regions discovered.
%

%
%  Reset all nonzero entries of ISHOW to -1.
