%% shape_ray_int_2d(): intersection ( regular shape, ray ) in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The "regular shape" is assumed to be an equilateral and equiangular
%    polygon, such as the standard square, pentagon, hexagon, and so on.
%
%    The origin of the ray is assumed to be inside the shape.  This
%    guarantees that the ray will intersect the shape in exactly one point.

%
%  Input:
%
%    real CENTER(2,1), the center of the shape.
%
%    real P1(2,1), the first vertex of the shape.
%
%    integer NSIDE, the number of sides in the shape.
%
%    real PA(2,1), the origin of the ray.
%
%    real PB(2,1), a second point on the ray.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real PI(2,1), the point on the shape intersected
%    by the ray.
%

%
%  Warning!
%  No check is made to ensure that the ray origin is inside the shape.
%  These calculations are not valid if that is not true!
