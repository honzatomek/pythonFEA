function volume = sphere_cap_volume_2d ( r, h )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% sphere_cap_volume_2d() computes the volume of a spherical cap in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Draw any radius R of the circle and denote as P the point where the
%    radius intersects the circle.  Now consider the point Q which lies
%    on the radius and which is H units from P.  The line which is
%    perpendicular to the radius R and passes through Q divides the
%    circle into two pieces.  The piece including the point P is the
%    spherical (circular) cap of height (or thickness) H.

%
%  Input:
%
%    real R, the radius of the sphere.
%
%    real H, the "height" of the spherical cap.  H must
%    be between 0 and 2 * R.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real VOLUME, the volume (area) of the spherical cap.
