%% halfspace_triangle_int_3d(): intersection ( halfspace, triangle ) in 3D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The triangle is specified by listing its three vertices.
%
%    The halfspace is not described in the input data.  Rather, the
%    distances from the triangle vertices to the halfspace are given.
%
%    The intersection may be described by the number of vertices of the
%    triangle that are included in the halfspace, and by the location of
%    points between vertices that separate a side of the triangle into
%    an included part and an unincluded part.
%
%    0 vertices, 0 separators    (no intersection)
%    1 vertex, 0 separators      (point intersection)
%    2 vertices, 0 separators    (line intersection)
%    3 vertices, 0 separators    (triangle intersection)
%
%    1 vertex, 2 separators,     (intersection is a triangle)
%    2 vertices, 2 separators,   (intersection is a quadrilateral).

%
%  Input:
%
%    real T(3,3), the vertices of the triangle.
%
%    real DIST1, DIST2, DIST3, the distances from each of
%    the three vertices of the triangle to the halfspace.  The distance is
%    zero if a vertex lies within the halfspace, or on the plane that
%    defines the boundary of the halfspace.  Otherwise, it is the
%    distance from that vertex to the bounding plane.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer NUM_INT, the number of intersection points returned,
%    which will always be between 0 and 4.
%
%    real PINT(3,4), the coordinates of the NUM_INT
%    intersection points.  The points will lie in sequence on the triangle.
%    Some points will be vertices, and some may be separators.
%
  dim_num = 3;
%
%  Walk around the triangle, looking for vertices that are included,
%  and points of separation.
