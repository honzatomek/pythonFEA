%% cylinder_point_dist_signed(): signed distance from cylinder to point.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    We are computing the signed distance to the SURFACE of the cylinder.
%
%    The surface of a (right) (finite) cylinder in 3D is defined by an axis,
%    which is the line segment from point P1 to P2, and a radius R.  The points
%    on the surface of the cylinder are:
%    * points at a distance R from the line through P1 and P2, and whose nearest
%      point on the line through P1 and P2 is strictly between P1 and P2,
%    PLUS
%    * points at a distance less than or equal to R from the line through P1
%      and P2, whose nearest point on the line through P1 and P2 is either
%      P1 or P2.
%
%    Points inside the surface have a negative distance.
%    Points on the surface have a zero distance.
%    Points outside the surface have a positive distance.

%  Input:

%    real R, the radius of the cylinder.
