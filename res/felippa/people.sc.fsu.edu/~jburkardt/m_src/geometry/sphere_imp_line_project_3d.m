%% sphere_imp_line_project_3d() projects a line onto an implicit sphere in 3D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    An implicit sphere in 3D satisfies the equation:
%
%      sum ( ( P(1:dim_num) - CENTER(1:dim_num) )^2 ) = R^2
%
%    The line to be projected is specified as a sequence of points.
%    If two successive points subtend a small angle, then the second
%    point is essentially dropped.  If two successive points subtend
%    a large angle, then intermediate points are inserted, so that
%    the projected line stays closer to the sphere.
%
%    Note that if any P coincides with the center of the sphere, then
%    its projection is mathematically undefined.  PP will
%    be returned as the center.

%
%  Input:
%
%    real R, the radius of the sphere.  If R is
%    zero, PP will be returned as the center, and if R is
%    negative, points will end up diametrically opposite from where
%    you would expect them for a positive R.
%
%    real CENTER(3), the center of the sphere.
%
%    integer N, the number of points on the line that is
%    to be projected.
%
%    real P(3,N), the coordinates of
%    the points on the line that is to be projected.
%
%    integer MAXPNT2, the maximum number of points on the projected
%    line.  Even if the routine thinks that more points are needed,
%    no more than MAXPNT2 will be generated.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer N2, the number of points on the projected line.
%    N2 can be zero, if the line has an angular projection of less
%    than THETAMIN radians.
%
%    real PP(3,N2), the coordinates
%    of the points representing the projected line.  These points lie on the
%    sphere.  Successive points are separated by at least THETAMIN
%    radians, and by no more than THETAMAX radians.
%
%    real THETAMIN, THETAMAX, the minimum and maximum
%    angular projections allowed between successive projected points.
%    If two successive points on the original line have projections
%    separated by more than THETAMAX radians, then intermediate points
%    will be inserted, in an attempt to keep the line closer to the
%    sphere.  If two successive points are separated by less than
%    THETAMIN radians, then the second point is dropped, and the
%    line from the first point to the next point is considered.
