%% lines_imp_int_2d() determines where two implicit lines intersect in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The implicit form of a line in 2D is:
%
%      A * X + B * Y + C = 0

%
%  Input:
%
%    real A1, B1, C1, define the first line.
%    At least one of A1 and B1 must be nonzero.
%
%    real A2, B2, C2, define the second line.
%    At least one of A2 and B2 must be nonzero.
%
%  Output:
%
%    integer IVAL, reports on the intersection.
%    -1, both A1 and B1 were zero.
%    -2, both A2 and B2 were zero.
%     0, no intersection, the lines are parallel.
%     1, one intersection point, returned in X, Y.
%     2, infinitely many intersections, the lines are identical.
%
%    real P(2,1), if IVAL = 1, then P is
%    the intersection point.  if IVAL = 2, then P is one of the
%    points of intersection.  Otherwise, P = [].
%

%
%  Refuse to handle degenerate lines.
