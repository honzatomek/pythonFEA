%% triangle_point_dist_signed_2d(): signed distance ( triangle, point ) in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    If the signed distance is:
%    0, the point is on the boundary of the triangle;
%    negative, the point is in the triangle;
%    positive, the point is outside the triangle.

%
%  Input:
%
%    real T(2,3), the triangle vertices.
%    These should be given in counter clockwise order.
%
%    real P(2,1), the point which is to be checked.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real DIST_SIGNED, the signed distance from the point to the triangle.
%
  dim_num = 2;
%
%  Compute the signed line distances to the point.

  dis12 = line_exp_point_dist_signed ( t(1:2,1), t(1:2,2), p );
  dis23 = line_exp_point_dist_signed ( t(1:2,2), t(1:2,3), p );
  dis31 = line_exp_point_dist_signed ( t(1:2,3), t(1:2,1), p );
%
%  If the point is inside the triangle, all the line distances are negative.
%  The largest (negative) line distance has the smallest magnitude,
%  and is the signed triangle distance.
%
  if ( dis12 <= 0.0 & dis23 <= 0.0 & dis31 <= 0.0 )

    dist_signed = max ( dis12, max ( dis23, dis31 ) );
%
%  If the point is outside the triangle, then we have to compute
%  the (positive) line segment distances and take the minimum.
