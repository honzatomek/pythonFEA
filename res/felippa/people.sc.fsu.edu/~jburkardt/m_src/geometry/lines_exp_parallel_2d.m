%% lines_exp_parallel_2d() determines if two lines are parallel in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The explicit form of a line in 2D is:
%
%      the line through the points P1, P2.
%
%    The test is essentially a comparison of slopes, but should be
%    more accurate than an explicit slope comparison, and unfazed
%    by degenerate cases.
%
%    On the other hand, there is NO tolerance for error.  If the
%    slopes differ by a single digit in the last place, then the
%    lines are judged to be nonparallel.  A more robust test would
%    be to compute the angle between the lines, because then it makes
%    sense to say the lines are "almost" parallel: the angle is small.

%  Input:

%    logical VALUE is TRUE if the lines are parallel.
