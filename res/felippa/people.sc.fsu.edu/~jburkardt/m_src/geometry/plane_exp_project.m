%% plane_exp_project() projects points through a point onto a plane.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The explicit form of a plane in 3D is
%
%      the plane through P1, P2 and P3.

%
%  Input:
%
%    real P1(3), P2(3), P3(3), three points on the plane.
%
%    real PF(3), the focus point.
%
%    integer N, the number of points to project.
%
%    real PO(3,N), the object points.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real PP(3,N), are the 
%    coordinates of the projections of the object points through the focus
%    point onto the plane.  PP may share the same memory as PO,
%    in which case the projections will overwrite the original data.
%
%    integer IVIS(N), visibility indicator:
%    3, the object was behind the plane;
%    2, the object was already on the plane;
%    1, the object was between the focus and the plane;
%    0, the line from the object to the focus is parallel to the plane,
%    so the object is "invisible".
%    -1, the focus is between the object and the plane.  The object
%    might be considered invisible.
%
  dim_num = 3;
%
%  Put the plane into ABCD form.
%
  [ a, b, c, d ] = plane_exp2imp_3d ( p1, p2, p3 );
%
%  Get the nearest point on the plane to the focus.
%
  pn = plane_imp_point_near_3d ( a, b, c, d, pf );
%
%  Get the distance from the focus to the plane.
%
  disfn = sqrt ( sum ( ( pf(1:dim_num) - pn(1:dim_num) ).^2 ) );
%
%  If the focus lies in the plane, this is bad.  We could still
%  project points that actually lie in the plane, but we'll
%  just bail out.

    ivis(1:n) = 0;

%  Get the distance from the focus to the object.
