%% planes_imp_angle_3d(): dihedral angle between implicit planes in 3D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The implicit form of a plane in 3D is:
%
%      A * X + B * Y + C * Z + D = 0
%
%    If two planes P1 and P2 intersect in a nondegenerate way, then there is a
%    line of intersection L0.  Consider any plane perpendicular to L0.  The
%    dihedral angle of P1 and P2 is the angle between the lines L1 and L2, where
%    L1 is the intersection of P1 and P0, and L2 is the intersection of P2 
%    and P0.
%
%    The dihedral angle may also be calculated as the angle between the normal
%    vectors of the two planes.  Note that if the planes are parallel or
%    coincide, the normal vectors are identical, and the dihedral angle is 0.

%
%  Input:
%
%    real A1, B1, C1, D1, coefficients that define the
%    first plane.
%
%    real A2, B2, C2, D2, coefficients that define
%    the second plane.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real ANGLE, the dihedral angle, in radians,
%    defined by the two planes.  If either plane is degenerate, or they
%    do not intersect, or they coincide, then the angle is set to Inf.
%    Otherwise, the angle is between 0 and PI.
