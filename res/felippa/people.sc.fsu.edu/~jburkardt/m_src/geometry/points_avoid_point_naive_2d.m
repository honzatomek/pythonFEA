%% points_avoid_point_naive_2d(): is a point "far" from a set of points in 2D?
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The routine discards points that are too close to other points.
%    The method used to check this is quadratic in the number of points,
%    and may take an inordinate amount of time if there are a large
%    number of points.  But in that case, what do you want?  If you want
%    lots of points, you don't want to delete any because it won't matter.
%
%    The test point is "far enough" from an accepted point if
%    the Euclidean distance is at least 100 times EPSILON.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the number of accepted points.
%
%    real P_SET(2,N), the accepted points.
%
%    real P(2), a point to be tested.
%
%  Output:
%
%    logical VALUE, is TRUE if XY_TEST is
%    "far enough" from all the accepted points.
