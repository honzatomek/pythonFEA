%  Input:
%
%    real X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3, are three sets of
%    data of the form ( X, F(X) ).  The three X values must be distinct.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real XMIN, YMIN.  XMIN is a point within the interval
%    spanned by X1, X2 and X3, at which F takes its local minimum
%    value YMIN.

%
%  Case 2: The curve decreases, and decreases faster than the line
%  joining the endpoints.
%
%  Whichever of SLOPE12 and SLOPE23 is the greater in magnitude
%  represents the actual slope of the underlying function.
%  Find where two lines of that slope, passing through the
%  endpoint data, intersect.
