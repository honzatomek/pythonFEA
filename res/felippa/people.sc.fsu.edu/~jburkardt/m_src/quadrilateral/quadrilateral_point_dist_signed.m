%% quadrilateral_point_dist_signed(): signed distance ( quadrilateral, point ).
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The quadrilateral must be convex.  DIST_SIGNED is actually the maximum
%    of the signed distances from the point to each of the four lines that
%    make up the quadrilateral.
%
%    Essentially, if the point is outside the convex quadrilateral,
%    only one of the signed distances can be positive, or two can
%    be positive and equal.

%
%  Input:
%
%    real Q(2,4), the vertices of the quadrilateral.
%
%    real P(2,1), the point which is to be checked.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real DIST_SIGNED, the signed distance from the
%    point to the convex quadrilateral.  If DIST_SIGNED is
%    0.0, the point is on the boundary;
%    negative, the point is in the interior;
%    positive, the point is in the exterior.
%

%
%  Compare the signed distance from each line segment to the point,
%  with the signed distance to the midpoint of the opposite line.
%
%  The signed distances should all be negative if the point is inside.
