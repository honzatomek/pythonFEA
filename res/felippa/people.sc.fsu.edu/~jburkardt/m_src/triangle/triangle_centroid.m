function centroid = triangle_centroid ( t )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% triangle_centroid() computes the centroid of a triangle in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The centroid of a triangle can also be considered the
%    center of gravity, or center of mass, assuming that the triangle
%    is made of a thin uniform sheet of massy material.
%
%    The centroid of a triangle is the intersection of the medians.
%
%    A median of a triangle is a line connecting a vertex to the
%    midpoint of the opposite side.
%
%    In barycentric coordinates, in which the vertices of the triangle
%    have the coordinates (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1), the centroid
%    has coordinates (1/3,1/3,1/3).
%
%    In geometry, the centroid of a triangle is often symbolized by "G".
