function value = r8_factorial_log ( n )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% r8_factorial_log() computes the natural logarithm of the factorial N!
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    LOG ( FACTORIAL ( N ) )
%      = LOG ( product ( 1 <= I <= N ) I )
%      = sum ( ( 1 <= I <= N ) LOG ( I ) )
%
%    Since 
%
%      FACTORIAL ( N ) = GAMMA ( N + 1 ),
%
%    and since MATLAB supplies in GAMMLN the logarithm of the Gamma
%    function, we may replace the calculation by a call to GAMMLN.

%
%  Input:
%
%    integer N, the argument of the factorial function.
%    If N is less than 1, VALUE is returned as 0.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real VALUE, the logarithm of the factorial of N.
