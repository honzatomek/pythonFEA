    <p>
      <b>triangulation_delaunay_discrepancy</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      computes the local Delaunay discrepancy of a triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      A (maximal) triangulation is Delaunay if and only if it is locally 
      Delaunay.
    </p>

    <p>
      A triangulation is Delaunay if the minimum angle over all triangles
      in the triangulation is maximized.  That is, there is no other
      triangulation of the points which has a larger minimum angle.
    </p>

    <p>
      A triangulation is locally Delaunay if, for every pair of triangles
      that share an edge, the minimum angle in the two triangles is larger
      than the minimum angle in the two triangles formed by removing the
      common edge and joining the two opposing vertices.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function examines the question of whether a given triangulation
      is locally Delaunay.  It does this by looking at every pair of
      neighboring triangles and comparing the minimum angle attained
      for the current triangle pair and the alternative triangle pair.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let A(i,j) be the minimum angle formed by triangles T(i) and T(j),
      which are two triangles in the triangulation which share a common edge.
      Let B(I,J) be the minimum angle formed by triangles S(i) and S(j),
      where S(i) and S(j) are formed by removing the common edge of T(i)
      and T(j), and joining the opposing vertices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the triangulation is Delaunay if B(i,j) <= A(i,j) for every
      pair of neighbors T(i) and T(j).  
    </p>

    <p>
      If A(i,j) &lt; B(i,j) for at least one pair of neighbors, the triangulation
      is not a Delaunay triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program returns VALUE = min ( A(i,j) - B(i,j) ) over all
      triangle neighbors.  VALUE is scaled to be in degrees, for
      comprehensibility.  If VALUE is negative, then at least one pair
      of triangles violates the Delaunay condition, and so the entire
      triangulation is not a Delaunay triangulation.  If VALUE is nonnegative,
      then the triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is useful to return VALUE, rather than a simple True/False value,
      because there can be cases where the Delaunay condition is only
      "slightly" violated.  A simple example is a triangulation formed
      by starting with a mesh of squares and dividing each square into
      two triangles by choosing one of the diagonals of the square.  
      The Delaunay discrepancy for this mesh, if computed exactly, is 0,
      but roundoff could easily result in discrepancies that were very
      slightly negative.
    </p>

    <p>
      If VALUE is positive, and not very small in magnitude, then every 
      pair of triangles in the triangulation satisfies the local Delaunay 
      condition, and so the triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If VALUE is negative, and not very small in magnitude, then at least 
      one pair of triangles violates the Delaunay condition, and to a 
      significant degree.  The triangulation is not a Delaunay triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the magnitude of VALUE is very close to zero, then the triangulation
      is numerically ambiguous.  At least one pair of triangles violates
      or almost violates the condition, but no triangle violates the
      condition to a great extent.  The user must judge whether the
      violation is significant or not.
