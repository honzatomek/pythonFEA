    <p>
      <b>dist_plot</b>,
      a MATLAB code which 
      creates a color contour plot of the distance function, as used in Strang and
      Persson's distmesh() program.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>dist_plot</b> ( <i>p, t, @fd</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>p</i>, a list of node coordinates;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>t</i>, a list of node indices forming a triangulation of the nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>@fd</i>, points to a distance function <b>d = fd ( p )</b>
          which computes the distance <b>d</b> from the region to any
          point <b>p</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
