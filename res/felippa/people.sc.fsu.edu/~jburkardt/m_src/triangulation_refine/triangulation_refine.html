    <p>
      <b>triangulation_refine</b>,
      a MATLAB code which 
      reads information 
      describing a triangulation of a set of points and creates
      a refined triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The refined triangulation is created by dividing each triangle
      into four similar subtriangles.  The mesh size parameter <b>h</b>
      will be halved by such a procedure.  If the input triangulation
      is Delaunay, then so will be the output triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program can handle triangulations that use 3 or 6 nodes
      per triangle.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input and output files use the simple TABLE format;
      comment lines begin with a "#" character.  Otherwise, each line
      of the file contains one set of information, either the coordinates
      of a node (for a node file), or the indices of nodes that make up
      a triangle, (for a triangle file).
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_nodes.txt contains the node information
      for the triangulation.  Each data line contains the X and 
      Y coordinates of a single node.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_elements.txt contains the triangle information
      for the triangulation.  Each line contains the indices of 3 or 6
      nodes that form a triangle.
    </p>
