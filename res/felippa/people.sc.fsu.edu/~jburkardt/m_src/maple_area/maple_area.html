    <p>
      <b>maple_area</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      uses several approaches to estimate the area of a maple leaf
      using an image.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a discussion of quasirandom sampling, Brian Hayes published a 
      picture of a maple leaf and considered how its area could be
      estimated using a regular grid of points, random sampling, or
      quasirandom sampling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The MAPLE_BOUNDARY functions used various MATLAB procedures to 
      turn the maple leaf image into a polygonal curve definining the 
      boundary.  The functions in MAPLE_AREA use various sampling
      techniques to estimate the area of the maple leaf.
