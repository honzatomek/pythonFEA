      <b>hand_data</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      carries out some numerical exercises based on data that came from
      tracing several points on a person's hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original proposer of this exercise was Cleve Moler, in the
      textbook <i>Numerical Computing with MATLAB</i>.

      human_data</a>,
      a MATLAB code which
      starts with an image of simple outline of a human body,
      tabulates a sequence of points on the outline, 
      creating numerical data defining the boundary.  It is then able
      to fill the region with mesh points and triangulate the region.
      This allows the region to be analyzed by the finite element method (FEM).
