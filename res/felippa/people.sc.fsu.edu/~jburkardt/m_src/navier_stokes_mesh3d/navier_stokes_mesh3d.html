      <b>navier_stokes_mesh3d</b>,
      MATLAB data files which 
      define meshes for several
      3D test problems involving the Navier Stokes equations
      for fluid flow, provided by Leo Rebholz.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are interested in these meshes as useful tests for a procedure
      in which we are able to redo the related Navier Stokes calculations
      using FENICS.  
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of that task, we need to take the meshes
      associated with the MATLAB computation and translate them into 
      a format acceptable to DOLFIN / FENICS.  Our proposed mechanism
      for this is either to translate the files to the Gmsh msh format,
      and then use DOLFIN-CONVERT to convert that to DOLFIN XML,
      or else to translate the files directly into DOLFIN XML format ourselves.

      The following MAT files each contain a mesh, defined by
      a structure whose components are nodeco, elnode, and bdynde:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "cylinder_3d.mat">cylinder_3d.mat</a>
          3D flow in a 0.41x2.5x0.41 channel, past a (square) cylinder,
          using 49,602 nodes, 9,792 elements, and 3,600 boundary nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "step_3d.mat">step_3d.mat</a>
          3D flow in a 10x50x10 channel, past a forward and backward step,
          using 38,992 nodes, 7,680 elements, and 2,954 boundary nodes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The following functions operate on the mesh data:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "display_element.m">display_element.m</a>
          reads information from the tet mesh file, and displays the
          coordinates of the nodes making up a particular element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "i4mat_write.m">i4mat_write.m</a>
          writes an I4MAT file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "mesh3d_extract.m">mesh3d_extract.m</a>
          loads an MAT file containing a mesh and extracts the
          3 components: node coordinates, element node indices,
          boundary nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "r8mat_write.m">r8mat_write.m</a>
