function qfsum = eiqfs ( nt, t, wts, f )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% eiqfs() evaluates a quadrature formula defined by CLIQF or CLIQFS.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    This routine evaluates an interpolatory quadrature formula with all knots
%    simple and all knots included in the quadrature.  This routine will be used
%    typically after CLIQF or CLIQFS has been called.

%  Input:
%
%    integer NT, the number of knots.

%    real WTS(NT), the weights.
%
%    function F, the name of a routine which
%    evaluates the function and some of its derivatives.  The routine
%    must have the form
%      function value = f ( x, i )
%    and return in VALUE the value of the I-th derivative of the function
%    at X.  The value of I will always be 0.  The value X will always be a knot.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real QFSUM, the value of the quadrature formula
%    applied to F.
