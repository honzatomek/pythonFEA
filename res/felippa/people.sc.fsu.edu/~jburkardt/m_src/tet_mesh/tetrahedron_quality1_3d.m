%% tetrahedron_quality1_3d(): "quality" of a tetrahedron in 3D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The quality of a tetrahedron is 3.0 times the ratio of the radius of
%    the inscribed sphere divided by that of the circumscribed sphere.
%
%    An equilateral tetrahredron achieves the maximum possible quality of 1.
