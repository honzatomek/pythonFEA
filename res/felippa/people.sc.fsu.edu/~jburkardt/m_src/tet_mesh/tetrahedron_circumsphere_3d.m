%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% tetrahedron_circumsphere_3d() computes the circumsphere of a tetrahedron in 3D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The circumsphere, or circumscribed sphere, of a tetrahedron is the sphere that
%    passes through the four vertices.  The circumsphere is not necessarily
%    the smallest sphere that contains the tetrahedron.
%
%    Surprisingly, the diameter of the sphere can be found by solving
%    a 3 by 3 linear system.  This is because the vectors P2 - P1,
%    P3 - P1 and P4 - P1 are secants of the sphere, and each forms a
%    right triangle with the diameter through P1.  Hence, the dot product of
%    P2 - P1 with that diameter is equal to the square of the length
%    of P2 - P1, and similarly for P3 - P1 and P4 - P1.  This determines
%    the diameter vector originating at P1, and hence the radius and
%    center.

%  Output:

%    real R, CENTER(3), the center of the
