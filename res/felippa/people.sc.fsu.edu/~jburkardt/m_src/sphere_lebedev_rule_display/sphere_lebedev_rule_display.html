    <p>
      <b>sphere_lebedev_rule_display</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      reads the name of a data file
      defining a Lebedev quadrature rule for the sphere,
      reads the file, creates an "XYZ" file containing the coordinates
      of the quadrature poins, and then
      and displays a unit sphere and the points in the MATLAB graphics window.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lebedev quadrature rule file contains a table of values of theta,
      phi, and weights.  The angles are measured in degrees.  So it is helpful
      to have this program read the data, convert angles to radians, compute
      the XYZ coordinates (and save the values in a file) and then display
      the point set.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>sphere_lebedev_rule_display</b> ( <i>'prefix'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i> is the prefix of the file containing the
          Lebedev rule.  If the file was 'lebedev_041.txt', then
          the prefix would be 'lebedev_041'.  The XYZ file that is
          created will use the same prefix, followed by '.xyz'.
        </li>
      </ul>
