function p = sphere_stereograph2_inverse ( q, focus, center )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% sphere_stereograph2_inverse() computes stereographic preimages of points.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    We start with a sphere of center C.
%
%    F is a point on the sphere which is the focus of the mapping,
%    and the antipodal point 2*C-F is the point of tangency
%    to the sphere of a plane.
%
%    For any point Q on the plane, the stereographic inverse projection
%    P of the point is defined by drawing the line from F through Q, and
%    computing P as the intersection of this line with the sphere.
%
%    The spatial dimension M is arbitrary, but should be at least 2.

%
%  Input:
%
%    real Q(M,N), the points, which are presumed to lie
%    on the plane.
%
%    real FOCUS(M,1), the coordinates of the focus point.
%
%    real CENTER(M,1), the coordinates of the center of the sphere.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real P(M,N), the stereographic inverse projections of the points.

  [ m, n ] = size ( q );
