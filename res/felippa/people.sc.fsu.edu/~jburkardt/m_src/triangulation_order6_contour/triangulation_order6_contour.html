    <p>
      <b>triangulation_order6_contour</b>,
      a MATLAB code which 
      reads datafiles describing a set of nodes, a triangulation of the nodes
      into six-node triangles, and a scalar evaluated at the nodes. 
      It produces a plot of the triangulation, and several styles of
      color contour plots of the scalar
    </p>

    <p>
      This program has a flaw - MATLAB can easily display linear data,
      so the program essentially divides each quadratic 6-node triangle into
      smaller 3-node triangles, and lets MATLAB compute and display a
      surface which is planar over each triangle.  This is only an
      approximation, and if the "fine scale" quadratic behavior of the 
      solution is of interest, it will not show up using this program!
      To do so well requires computing the underlying quadratic function at
      numerous sampling points before constructing and displaying the
      (now much smaller) planar surfaces that approximate the quadratic
      surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program reads three data files that form a "finite element model"
      of a scalar quantity defined over a 2D region:
      <ul>
        <li>
          a <i>node</i> file, containing 
          X, Y coordinates of points;
        </li>
        <li>
          an <i>element</i> file, 
          containing a list of sets of six points making up each 
          triangular element;
        </li>
        <li>
          a <i>value</i> file, 
          containing the value of a scalar function U(X,Y) evaluated
          at each node.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program automatically displays five plots:
      <ol>
        <li>
          An image of the 3-node triangles created by discarding the
          midside nodes of the input triangulation;
        </li>
        <li>
          A color contour plot, using the crude 3-node triangulation,
          with color constant over a triangle.
        </li>
        <li>
          An image of the finer 3-node triangles created by breaking
          the 6-node triangles into 4 3-node triangles.
        </li>
        <li>
          A color contour plot, using the finer 3-node triangulation,
          with color constant over a triangle.
        </li>
        <li>
          A color contour plot, using the finer 3-node triangulation,
          with color linearly interpolated to make a very nice picture.
        </li>
      </ol>
