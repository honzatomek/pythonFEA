      IHS <br> Improved Distributed Hypercube Sampling Datasets
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IHS</b> 
      is a dataset directory which
      contains points generated
      by the M-dimensional Improved Distributed Hypercube Sampling process.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Latin hypercube, in <b>M</b> dimensional space, with <b>N</b> points,
      can be thought of as being constructed by dividing each of the 
      <b>M</b> coordinate dimensions into <b>N</b> equal intervals.  The 
      J-th coordinate of the I-th point can be constructed by choosing, in 
      the J-th dimension, an interval that has not been used, and then
      choosing any value in that interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      This algorithm differs in that it tries to pick a solution 
      which has the property that the points are "spread out"
      as evenly as possible.  It does this by determining an optimal
      even spacing, and using the duplication factor D to allow it
      to choose the best of the various options available to it
      (the more duplication, the better chance of optimization).
    </p>

    <p>
      The IHS algorithm, at least as currently programmed, uses
      time that is quadratic in the number of points.  This means
      that, for large N, it is much slower than most quasirandom 
      sequence methods.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The datasets are distinguished by the values of the following
      parameters:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>M</b>, the spatial dimension;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>N</b>, the number of points to generate;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>D</b>, the duplication factor, which controls how
          many "chances" the algorithm has to find good candidates;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SEED</b>, the initial value of the seed used for
          UNIFORM, a portable uniform random number generator;
        </li>
      </ul>
      The values of M, N, D and SEED are specified as part of the 
      dataset file names.
