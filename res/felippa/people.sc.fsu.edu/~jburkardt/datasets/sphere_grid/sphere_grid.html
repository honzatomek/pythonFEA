    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_GRID</b> 
      is a dataset directory which
      contains "grids" on a sphere.  
      For simplicity, the sphere is always assumed to have a radius of 1,
      and center at the origin.
    </p>

    <p>
      The grid may be
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>a point grid</i>, simply a set of points.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>a line grid</i>, a set of points, and a list of pairs of
          points that form line segments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>a triangle grid</i>, a set of points, and a list of triples of
          points that form triangles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>a quadrilateral grid</i>, a set of points, and a list of 
          quartets of points that form quadrilaterals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>SPHERE_GRID_ICOS1_F*</b> is a family of point grids.
      The first grid is formed by the 12 vertices of an icosahedron
      The second grid replaces each triangular face of the icosahedron
      by 2*2 triangles, and projects all the new vertices onto the sphere.
      The third grid refines each triangle to 9 subtriangles, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      The points were computed by the SPHERE_GRID program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The triangulations were computed by the STRIPACK_DELAUNAY program
      (which calls STRIPACK).
    </p>

    <p>
      These grids are produced by linear interpolation on
      the (straight) edges of the icosahedron, instead of on the (curved)
      edges of the image of the icosahedron on the sphere.
