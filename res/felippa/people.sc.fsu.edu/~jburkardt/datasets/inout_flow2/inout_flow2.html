    <p>
      <b>INOUT_FLOW2</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains velocity solutions to a time-dependent
      incompressible parameterized flow problem in in a cell with 
      inflow and outflow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "INOUT" region is contained in the unit square, [0,1] x [0,1].
      There is an inlet on the left side, from [0,0] to [0,0.2], and an
      outlet on the right side, from [1,0.8] to [1.0,1.0].

      There are 3,721 nodes in a 61 by 61 evenly spaced grid.  The nodes
      are organized into 1800 6-node triangular elements
      which are quadratic in velocity and linear in pressure. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The time-dependent incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations
      are to be applied in the region.  No-slip and no-penetration
      conditions are applied along the walls.  The inlet on the lower
      left is open, and parabolic velocity inflow is specified, whose
      strength is controlled by a parameter <b>alpha</b>.  At the outlet
      on the upper right, the flow is specified to have zero vertical
      component, and zero horizontal derivative.  The dynamic 
      viscosity is taken to be <b>nu</b>=1/300.
    </p>

    <p>
      The steady state solution is computed for the particular value
      <b>alpha</b>=1/3.  Using the steady state solution as initial condition,
      the time-dependent problem is solved over the
      interval <b>0&lt;=t&lt;=40</b>, using 4,000 timesteps of size
      <b>dt=0.01</b>.  Only every 5th timestep is saved as a "snapshot".
      The parameter <b>alpha</b> is set to 5/3 for timesteps 1 
      through 400, and then <b>alpha</b> = 1/3 for timesteps 401 through
      800.  The two instantaneous changes to <b>alpha</b> induce violent
      transient behaviors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to extract typical modes of behavior of the solution.  
      Such a set of modes may then be used as a finite element basis that 
      is highly tuned to the physics of the problem, so that a very small set of
      basis functions can be used to closely approximate the behavior
      of the solution over a range of values of <b>alpha</b>.
