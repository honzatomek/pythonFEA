      Datasets:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Files with an extension of <b>.txt</b> are "text" files; the
      columns of data are separated by spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      Files with an extension of <b>.csv</b> are "comma separated value" files; the
      columns of data are separated by commas.  These files often have an initial
      "header" line containing a label for each column.  Each label is generally
      delimited by quotation marks.
    </p>

      <b>anscombe</b> contains four sets of 11 pairs of (x,y) data.
      Sets (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) and (x4,y4) all have the same
      average x, average y, the same regression line: y = 3 + 0.5 * x,
      the same variance, the same correlation coefficient, and the same
      value of r^2.  And yet these datasets, when plotted, are obviously
      quite different.
