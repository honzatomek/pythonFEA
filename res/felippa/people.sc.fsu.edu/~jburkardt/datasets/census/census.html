      CENSUS <br> US State Populations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CENSUS</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains some census data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The US Constitution mandates that the apportionment of the House
      of Representatives be based on the population of the states, and
      that a census of state populations be made every ten years for
      this purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      The files here contain some rough, recent census results for the states.
      With a little care, this information can be used to study various 
      schemes for "fair" distribution of the seats in the 
      House of Representatives.
