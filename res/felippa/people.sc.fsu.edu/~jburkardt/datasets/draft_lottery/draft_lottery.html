    <p>
      <b>DRAFT_LOTTERY</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains the numbers assigned to each birthday, for the Selective Service System
      lotteries for 1970 through 1976.
    </p>

    <p>
      An analysis of the results for the 1970 lottery showed that a bias in the results,
      so that people born later in the year tended to have lower lottery numbers, and hence
      a greater likelihood of being drafted.
    </p>

    <p>
      <table border="1" align = "center">
        <tr>
          <th>Month</th><th>Average Draft Number</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>January</td><td>201</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>February</td><td>203</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>March</td><td>225</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>April</td><td>203</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>

      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, we can also analyze the table by day of the week.
      Arbitrarily assuming that January 1 was Sunday (it's pointless to be
      precise in this case, since the first lottery included several years),
      we have the following breakdown:
      <table border="1" align = "center">
        <tr>
          <th>Weekday</th><th>Average Draft Number</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sunday</td><td>181</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Monday</td><td>187</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tuesday</td><td>179</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Wednesday</td><td>204</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Thursday</td><td>176</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Friday</td><td>164</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Saturday</td><td>195</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
