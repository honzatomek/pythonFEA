      TSP <br> Data for the Traveling Salesperson Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TSP</b>,
      a dataset directory which
      contains some examples of data for the traveleing salesperson problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of these examples come from TSPLIB, a collection of
      traveling salesman problem datasets maintained by Gerhard Reinelt at
      <a href = "http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/">
                "http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/"</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the traveling salesperson problem, a salesperson, who lives in one
      of the cities, is expected to make a round trip visiting all the
      other cities and returning home.  (It doesn't actually matter which
      city is the starting point.)  The requirement is that the total distance
      traveled be as small as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      It turns out that this simple problem is actually remarkably hard to
      solve, particularly if one insists on finding the absolutely best answer.
      Approaches to solving this problem have used simple enumeration, Monte
      Carlo estimation, minimal spanning trees, linear programming, 
      simulated annealing, Tabu searches, the branch and bound procedure, 
      the integer assignment problem, the convex hull, genetic algorithms, 
      ant colony algorithms, and the cross-entropy method,
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, this simple problem has been the inspiration for many new ways of
      trying to solve not just the traveling salesperson problem but related
      "combinatorial optimization" problems, in which a discrete set of choices
      result in a payoff which is to be maximized or a cost which is to be minimized.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the simplest version of the traveling salesperson problem, it is possible to travel
      from any city A to any city B, and the distance is the same both ways.
      This might be imagined to correspond to travel by air.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In a variation of the problem, it might not be possible to travel
      directly between certain cities.  This is essentially equivalent to setting
      the corresponding intercity distance to be infinite.  This could
      be considered an attempt to include the realities of highway travel.
    </p>

    <p>
      To specify the problem, we may provide the spatial coordinates of the 
      N points.  Here again, there can be complications.  It would be
      natural to expect coordinates on a plane, with the Euclidean distance,
      but the data might be more accurately described as lying on a sphere,
      with travel constrained to the surface; or we might have locations
      in a gridded city, in which case distance is measured with the L1
      norm rather than the Euclidean norm, and there are further obvious
      variations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we are given a set of coordinates and a description of the distance
      function, we can compute the distance matrix.  So we might suppose
      that any distance matrix comes from a set of point coordinates.  But
      that's not true.  If we start with the distance matrix, we are free
      to put down numbers that violate the triangle inequality, for instance.
      Problems in which the data does not come from an underlying set of
      point coordinates and a norm turn out to be much harder, since
      certain geometric facts can no longer be used to estimate the solution.  
    </p>

    <p>
      For the data considered here, we will expect symmetry, that is,
      that the distance is the same coming and going.  We will allow
      problems to be specified either by node coordinates and a norm,
      (usually 2D planar points and the Euclidean norm) or by an
      abstract distance matrix.
