    <p>
      <b>TETRAHEDRON_SAMPLES</b> 
      is a dataset directory which
      contains sets of sample points from the unit tetrahedron.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unit tetrahedron has vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,0).
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a function <b>rand()</b> which returns values in the interval [0,1],
      it is easy to construct methods of sampling the unit square, cube, and
      the general hypercube.  It is not quite so easy to deal with the triangle,
      tetrahedron, and general simplex.
    </p>

    <p>
      This directory collects sets of sample points of various sizes, so that
      it is easy to find data that one can check for uniformity.
