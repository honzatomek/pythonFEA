      KNAPSACK_MULTIPLE <br> Data for the 01 Multiple Knapsack Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>KNAPSACK_MULTIPLE</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains some examples of data for 01 Multiple Knapsack problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the 01 Multiple Knapsack problem, we are given M knapsacks of capacities C(1:M).
      We are also given a list of N objects, of weight W(1:N) and profit P(1:N).
      Our goal is to select objects which can fit into the knapsacks in such a way
      that we maximize the value of the selected items.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, we are to
      determine an MxN selection matrix X, whose entries are 0 or 1, such that
      there is at most a single 1 in any row.  X represents our selections, and it
      must be the case that
      <pre>
        sum ( I ) X(I,J) * W(J) <= C(J)  for each J
      </pre>
      while we try to maximize our total profit:
      <pre>
        sum ( I ) sum ( J ) X(I,J) * P(J)
      </pre>
    </p>
