    <p>
      <b>HAMMERSLEY</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains points generated
      by the M-dimensional Hammersley sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Routines in this library select elements of a "leaped" subsequence of 
      the Hammersley sequence.  The subsequence elements are indexed by a
      quantity called STEP, which starts at 0.  The STEP-th subsequence 
      element is simply the Hammersley sequence element with index  
      <pre>
        SEED(1:NDIM) + STEP * LEAP(1:NDIM).
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The arguments that the user may set include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          NDIM, the spatial dimension, <br>
          default: NDIM = 1, <br>
          required: 1 &lt;= NDIM;
        </li>
        <li>
          STEP, the subsequence index.<br>
          default: STEP = 0,<br>
          required: 0 &lt;= STEP.
        </li>
        <li>
          SEED(1:NDIM), the Hammersley sequence index corresponding 
          to STEP = 0.<br>
          default: SEED(1:NDIM) = (0, 0, ... 0),<br>
          required: 0 &lt;= SEED(1:NDIM);
        </li>
        <li>
          LEAP(1:NDIM), the succesive jumps in the Hammersley sequence.<br>
          default: LEAP(1:NDIM) = (1, 1, ..., 1).<br>
          required: 1 &lt;= LEAP(1:NDIM).
        </li>
        <li>
          BASE(1:NDIM), the Hammersley bases.<br>
          default: BASE(1:NDIM) = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11... ),<br>
          or (-N, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,...) if <b>N</b> is known;<br>
          required: 1 &lt; BASE(I) for any van der Corput dimension I, or
            BASE(I) &lt; 0 to generate the fractional sequence J/|BASE(I)|.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the standard NDIM-dimensional Hammersley sequence, it is assumed
      that <b>N</b>, the number of values to be generated, is known
      beforehand.  The first dimension of entries in the sequence 
      will have the form <b>J/N</b> for J from 1 to N.  The remaining
      dimensions are computed using the 1-dimensional
      <a href = "../van_der_corput/van_der_corput.html">
      van der Corput sequence</a>, using successive primes as bases.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a generalized Hammersley sequence, each coordinate is allowed
      to be a fractional or van der Corput sequence.  For any fractional
      sequence, the denominator is arbitrary.  However, it is extremely
      desirable that the values in all coordinates stay between 0 and 1.
      This happens automatically for any van der Corput sequence, but
      for fractional sequences, this criterion is enforced using an 
      appropriate <i>modulus</i> function.  The consequence is that if
      you specify a small "base" for a fractional sequence, your sequence
      will soon wrap around and you will get repeated values.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you drop the first dimension of the standard NDIM-dimensional
      Hammersley sequence, you get the standard 
      <a href = "../halton/halton.html">Halton sequence</a> of dimension NDIM-1.
    </p>

    <p>
      The standard Hammersley sequence has slightly better dispersion 
      properties than the standard Halton sequence.  However, it suffers 
      from the problem that you must know, beforehand, the number of points you
      are going to generate.  Thus, if you have computed a Hammersley
      sequence of length <b>N</b> = 100, and you want to compute a
      Hammersley sequence of length 200, you must discard your current 
      values and start over.  By contrast, you can compute 100 points of 
      a Halton sequence, and then 100 more, and this will be the same 
      as computing the first 200 points of the Halton sequence in 
      one calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In low dimensions, the multidimensional Hammersley sequence quickly
      "fills up" the space in a well-distributed pattern.  However,
      for higher dimensions (such as NDIM = 40) for instance, the initial
      elements of the Hammersley sequence can be very poorly distributed;
      it is only when N, the number of sequence elements, is large 
      enough relative to the spatial dimension, that the sequence is 
      properly behaved.  Remedies for this problem were suggested
      by Kocis and Whiten.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some cases, it is recommended that the initial portion of
      the sequence be skipped over.  A general suggestion is to
      let STEP be the first power of 2 that is equal to or
      greater than N, the number of points to generate.
