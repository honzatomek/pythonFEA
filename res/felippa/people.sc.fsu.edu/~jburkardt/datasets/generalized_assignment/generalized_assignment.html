      GENERALIZED_ASSIGMENT <br> Data for the Generalized Assignment Problem
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>GENERALIZED_ASSIGMENT</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains some examples of data for Generalized Assignment problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Generalized Assignment problem, we are given M knapsacks of capacities C(1:M).
      We are also given a list of N objects, with corresponding weights and profits.
      However, the weight and profit of an object now depend on the knapsack to which
      it is defined, so we have MxN arrays W and P.
      Our goal is to assign each object to exactly one knapsack so that no knapsack's
      capacity is exceeded, and the total profit is maximized.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, we are to
      determine an MxN selection matrix X, whose entries are 0 or 1, such that
      there is exactly a single 1 in any row.  X represents our selections, and it
      must be the case that
      <pre>
        sum ( I ) X(I,J) * W(I,J) <= C(J)  for each J
      </pre>
      while we try to maximize our total profit:
      <pre>
        sum ( I ) sum ( J ) X(I,J) * P(I,J)
      </pre>
    </p>
