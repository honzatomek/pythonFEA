    <p>
      <b>TIME_SERIES</b> 
      is a data directory which
      contains examples of files describing time series.
    </p>

    <p>
      A time series is simply a sequence of values of a time dependent
      quantity.  Often, the samples are taken at a constant time interval.
      Examples of time series include the Dow-Jones stock index, 
      the daily noon temperature reading at the Roanoke airport or
      the yearly estimate of Mexico's population.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a time series, there are some natural tasks that might arise,
      including interpolation (estimating values at intermediate points),
      integration (estimating the area below the curve from which the
      samples were taken) or Fourier analysis (searching for underlying
      "rhythms" or "tides" or natural cycles that compose a significant portion of
      the observed data).
