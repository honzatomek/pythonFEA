    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGLE_SAMPLES</b> 
      is a dataset directory which
      contains sets of sample points from the unit triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unit triangle has vertices (1,0), (0,1), (0,0).
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a function <b>rand()</b> which returns values in the interval [0,1],
      it is easy to construct methods of sampling the unit square, cube, and
      the general hypercube.  It is not quite so easy to deal with the triangle,
      tetrahedron, and general simplex.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the triangle, things are not so serious.  The simplest method involves
      rejection, generating points in the unit square and discarding those that
      are outside the triangle.  Another simple method simply "folds" points
      that lie above the line x+y=1, which means no generated points are rejected.
      Other methods work with the barycentric coordinates that can be applied
      as well to the general triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      This directory collects sets of sample points of various sizes, so that
      it is easy to find data that one can check for uniformity.
