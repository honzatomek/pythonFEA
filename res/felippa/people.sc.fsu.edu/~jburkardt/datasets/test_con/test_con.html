      TEST_CON <br> Continuation Data
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TEST_CON</b> 
      is a dataset directory which
      is associated with the sample continuation problems in the TEST_CON software library.
    </p>

    <p>
      The TEST_CON software library defines 19 problems, some of them with several
      options.  Each problem and option defines a nonlinear set of functions with
      one degree of freedom.  The solutions of this function lie on a curve.
      Continuation codes try to produce a series of points on such a curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      For some of the nonlinear functions defined by TEST_CON software, this
      directory has a corresponding directory containing points X
      and tangent vectors T(X) representing a series of solutions on the curve.
      This data can be used for plotting, or for comparison with results obtained
      by other programs.
