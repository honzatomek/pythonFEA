This example is known as Runge's problem.

The function f(x) = 1/(1+25*x*x) is evaluated at N points X in [-1,+1].
The points X may be equally spaced, or Chebyshev points (cosines of
angles equally spaced between 0 and pi).  Interpolation at the equally
spaced data points becomes increasingly oscillatory.
