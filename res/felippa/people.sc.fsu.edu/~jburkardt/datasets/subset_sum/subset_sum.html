      SUBSET_SUM <br> Data for the Subset Sum Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUBSET_SUM</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains some examples of data for the subset sum problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The subset sum problem is given a target value C and a set of N numbers W
      and seeks one or more subset of W that add up to exactly C, or if that is
      not possible, to come as close to C as possible without exceeding it.
    </p>

    <p>
      An optimal solution is a subset W whose elements add up to C.  An
      optimal solution does not always exist.  A <i>suboptimal solution</i> is 
      a subset W whose elements add up to a number Csub which is less than or 
      equal to C, such that there is no other subset whose sum is greater than 
      Csub but less than or equal to C.  For any subset sum problem, there is 
      always at least one suboptimal solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      A solution of the subset sum problem can be regarded as a binary
      number between 0 and 2^N-1, with the I-th binary digit indicating whether
      item I is included or excluded from the sum.
    </p>

    <p>
      The subset problem problem is a special case of the 0-1 Knapsack problem,
      in which the profit of every item is equal to its weight.
