      BIN_PACKING <br> Data for the Bin Packing Problem
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>BIN_PACKING</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains some examples of data for the bin packing problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the bin packing problem, we are given a set of N objects, of a variety of
      weights W(I).  We have an unlimited supply of bins, each of capacity C.
      Our goal is to assign each object to a bin in such a way that we do not
      exceed the capacity of any bin, while using the fewest number of bins possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, a solution of the bin packing problem is an assignment vector S of
      length N which indicates which bin each object goes to, and the "cost" of
      the solution is the maximum bin index.

      the same strategy ends up using 8 bins!  This example is due to
      Ronald Graham.
