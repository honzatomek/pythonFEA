    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUADRATURE_RULES_HERMITE_PHYSICIST</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains examples of quadrature rules of Gauss-Hermite type
      using the physicist weight.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Gauss-Hermite quadrature rules are designed to approximate integrals on
      the infinite interval (-oo,+oo).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Gauss Hermite quadrature assumes that the integrand we are
      considering has a form like:
      <pre>
        Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) w(x) * f(x) dx
      </pre>
      where the factor <b>w(x)</b> is regarded as a weight factor.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are three common variations of the rule, depending on the
      form of the weight factor w(x):
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 0, the unweighted rule:
          <pre>
            Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) f(x) dx
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 1, the physicist weighted rule:
          <pre>
            Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) exp(-x*x) f(x) dx
          </pre>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 2, the probabilist weighted rule:
          <pre>
            Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) exp(-x*x/2) f(x) dx
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The corresponding Gauss-Hermite rule that uses <b>order</b> points
      will approximate the integral by
      <pre>
        sum ( 1 &lt;= i &lt;= order ) w(i) * f(x(i)) 
      </pre>
      where, confusingly, <b>w(i)</b> is a vector of quadrature weights, which has no
      connection with the <b>w(x)</b> weight function.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this directory, a quadrature rule is stored as three files,
      containing the weights, the points, and a file containing two
      points defining the endpoints of the region.  Since the Hermite rules
      are defined on an infinite region, we set the endpoints to a very
      large negative and positive values respectively, and hope the program
      will understand what we mean.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a Gauss-Hermite rule of order <b>n</b> is computed and evaluated with no numerical error,
      then it should produce the exact integral of any (weighted) polynomial of degree <b>2*n-1</b> or less.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a simple check, for the physicist rule, the weights should add to 
      sqrt(pi) = 1.7724538509055160273
    </p>

      Example:
    </h3>

    <p>
      We consider a physicist weighted Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule of order 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the text of the "W" file storing the weights of such a rule:
      <pre><code>
  0.2954089751509195    
   1.181635900603677    
  0.2954089751509196    
       </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the text of the "X" file storing the abscissas of such a rule:
      <pre><code> 
  -1.224744871391589    
 -0.9862844991098402E-16
   1.224744871391589 
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the text of the "R" file storing the lower and upper limits of
      the region.  These are formally -oo and +oo, but here we simply give
      them as large values.
      <pre><code>
 -0.1000000000000000E+31
  0.1000000000000000E+31
      </code></pre>
