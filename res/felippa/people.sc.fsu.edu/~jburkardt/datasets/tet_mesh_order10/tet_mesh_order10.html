    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TET_MESH_ORDER10</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains examples of 10-node "tet meshes"
      (meshes of tetrahedrons).  In such a mesh, the fundamental shape
      is a tetrahedron, but each tetrahedron is described by 10 nodes,
      namely, the four vertices, and the six midside nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Typically, such a mesh is <i>not</i> generated directly from
      arbitrary data, since the midside nodes are expected to be the
      averages of pairs of vertices, or nearly so.  It is more typical
      that a linear mesh, using 4-node tetrahedrons, is generated,
      and then a quadratic mesh is derived from the linear mesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      A 10-node tet mesh is called <i>quadratic</i> since it easily allows
      for piecewise quadratic interpolation of data values defined
      at the nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The definition of an order 10 tet mesh requires two files:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the <i>node file</i> lists the coordinates of
          a set of points.
        </li>
        <li>
          the <i>element file</i> lists groups of 10 node indices, which
          form each element.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      There is little agreement about how to order the nodes that describe
      a 10-node tetrahedron.  The first four nodes are always the vertices.
      We might label them as "A", "B", "C", and "D".  Then the six remaining
      nodes are each halfway between a pair of vertices, and in fact can be
      uniquely identified by that pair.  Thus, the node between vertices
      B and D could be called "BD".  One way to order these six nodes
      is to sort the two bracketing vertices and list the pairs in order.
      In that case, the full set of 10 nodes might be listed as
      <blockquote>
        A, B, C, D, AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.
      </blockquote>

      Example of a tet element file:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Each tetrahedron will be described by a list of 10 nodes.
      An arbitrary ordering for these nodes must be imposed.  It
      is natural to list the four vertices first, but the 6 midside
      nodes have no natural ordering.  Here, then, is one ordering
      that we use, where we have indicated the position of the midside
      nodes by listing the two "parent" vertices:
      <pre>
        1, 2, 3, 4, (1+2), (1+3), (1+4), (2+3), (2+4), (3+4)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A possible tet mesh of these nodes would be described
      by the following element file:
      <pre>
       4   3   5   1  16  19  11  17   10  12
       4   2   5   1  13  19  11  14    9  12
       4   7   3   5  21  16  19  18   24  17
       4   7   8   5  21  22  19  27   24  25
       4   6   2   5  20  13  19  15   23  14
       4   6   8   5  20  22  19  26   23  25
