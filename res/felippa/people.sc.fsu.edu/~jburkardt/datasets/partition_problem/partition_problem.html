      PARTITION_PROBLEM <br> Data for the Partition Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PARTITION_PROBLEM</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains some examples of data for the partition problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The partition problem is given a set of N numbers W, and it is desired
      to separate these numbers into two subsets W1 and W2 so that the sums of
      the numbers in each subset are equal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The partition problem is a special case of the subset sum problem,
      in which the target sum is one half the sum of the entire set W.
