#  Discussion:
#
#    This is simply a list of the total system size,
#    and the files that describe the subsystems.
#
#    The first subsystem is a matrix A and right hand side B
#    whose residual norm || A * X - B || is to be minimized.
#
#    The second subsystem is a matrix C and right hand side D
#    which represent constraints, that is, it must be the
#    case that C * X = D exactly.
#
#    The third subsystem is a matrix E and right hand side H
#    which represent positivity constraints, that is, it must be the
#    case that E * X >= H.
#
#    The rank of A is 3, the rank of C is 2.  The value of the
#    objective function for the L1 problem is 31.34014.
