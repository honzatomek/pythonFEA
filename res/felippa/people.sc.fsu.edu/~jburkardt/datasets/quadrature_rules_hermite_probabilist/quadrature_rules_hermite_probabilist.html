    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUADRATURE_RULES_HERMITE_PROBABILIST</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains examples of quadrature rules of Gauss-Hermite type
      using the probabilist weight.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Gauss-Hermite quadrature rules are designed to approximate integrals on
      the infinite interval (-oo,+oo).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Gauss Hermite quadrature assumes that the integrand we are
      considering has a form like:
      <pre>
        Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) f(x) * rho(x) dx
      </pre>
      where the factor <b>w(x)</b> is regarded as a weight factor.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are variations of the rule, depending on the
      form of the weight factor rho(x):
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 0, the unweighted rule:
          <pre>
            rho(x) = 1
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 1, the physicist weighted rule:
          <pre>
            rho = exp(-x*x)
          </pre>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 2, the probabilist weighted rule:
          <pre>
            rho = exp(-x*x/2)
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 3, the physicist normalized weighted rule:
          <pre>
            rho = exp(-x*x) / sqrt ( pi )
          </pre>
        <li>
          <b>option</b> = 4, the probabilist normalized weighted rule:
          <pre>
            rho = exp(-x*x/2) / sqrt ( 2 pi )
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The corresponding Gauss-Hermite rule that uses <b>order</b> points
      will approximate the integral by
      <pre>
        sum ( 1 &lt;= i &lt;= order ) w(i) * f(x(i)) 
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For this directory, a quadrature rule is stored as three files,
      containing the weights, the points, and a file containing two
      points defining the endpoints of the region.  Since the Hermite rules
      are defined on an infinite region, we set the endpoints to a very
      large negative and positive values respectively, and hope the program
      will understand what we mean.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a Gauss-Hermite rule of order <b>n</b> is computed and evaluated with no numerical error,
      then it should produce the exact integral of any (weighted) polynomial of degree <b>2*n-1</b> or less.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a simple check, for the unnormalized probabilist rule, the weights should add to 
      sqrt(2*pi) = 2.5066282746310005024, while for the normalized probabilist rule,
      the weights should add to 1.
    </p>

      Example:
    </h3>

    <p>
      We consider a probabilist unnormalized weighted Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule of order 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the text of the "W" file storing the weights of such a rule:
      <pre><code>
  0.4177713791051669    
   1.671085516420666    
  0.4177713791051672      
       </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the text of the "X" file storing the abscissas of such a rule:
      <pre><code> 
  -1.732050807568878    
 -0.1394816914999491E-15
   1.732050807568878    
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the text of the "R" file storing the lower and upper limits of
      the region.  These are formally -oo and +oo, but here we simply give
      them as large values.
      <pre><code>
 -0.1000000000000000E+31
  0.1000000000000000E+31
      </code></pre>
