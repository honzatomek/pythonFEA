    <p>
      <b>STATES</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains some information about American states.
    </p>

    <p>
      Files are available listing the area, population, capitals, postal
      codes, statehood date, and other information.  In most cases, the
      files include information for all 50 states, but also the District
      of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the United States itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      In most cases, the files contain a single line of data for each state.
      The lines are given in alphabetical order of the full state name.
      Each line begins with a two-letter postal code identifier for the
      state, whose alphabetic order is "almost" consistent with that of
      the full state names.
