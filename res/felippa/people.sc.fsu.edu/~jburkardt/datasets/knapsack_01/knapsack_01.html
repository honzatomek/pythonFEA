      KNAPSACK_01 <br> Data for the 01 Knapsack Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>KNAPSACK_01</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains some examples of data for 01 Knapsack problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the 01 Knapsack problem, we are given a knapsack of fixed capacity C.
      We are also given a list of N objects, each having a weight W(I) and profit P(I).
      We can put any subset of the objects into the knapsack, as long as the total
      weight of our selection does not exceed C.  We desire to maximize our total profit,
      which is the sum of the profits of each object we put into the knapsack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, a solution of the 01 Knapsack problem is a subset S of the N objects
      for which the weight sum is less than or equal to C, and which maximizes the
      total profit.
