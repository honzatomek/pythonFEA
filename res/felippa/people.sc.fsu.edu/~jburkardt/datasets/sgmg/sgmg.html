      SGMG <br> Sparse Grids from Mixed 1D Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SGMG</b>
      is a dataset directory which
      contains some examples of sparse grids in which different 1D quadrature
      rules may be used for each spatial dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      These sparse grids are different from those stored in the SPARSE_GRID_MIXED
      dataset directory.  These sparse grids have a variation in the way the 1D
      rules grow with the level.  Essentially, the original rule was "exponential"
      in every case.  Roughly speaking, the next 1D level used twice as many points.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the <b>SGMG</b> family, however, the default growth
      rate depends on the rule.  Thus:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>exponential growth rate</i> is reserved, by default, for
          "CC", "F2" and "GP" rules.
          linear growth rate for other rules (
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>linear growth rate</i> of 2*L+1, where L is the level,
          is reserved for "GL", "GH", "GGH", "LG", "GLG", "GJ" and "GW" rules.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The following list includes 1D quadrature rules that may be specified
      as factors.  A few rules are not yet supported.

        <li>
          <b>GJ</b>, Gauss Jacobi: <br>
          defined on [-1,+1] with w(x)=(1-x)^alpha (1+x)^beta<br>

          <i>(not supported yet)</i>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Each sparse grid is stored using the "weighted quadrature rule" format,
      that is, as 5 files:
      <ul>
        <li>
          an "N" or "number of parameters" file, which lists the number of parameters
         (such as ALPHA and BETA) for each dimension;
        </li>
        <li>
          an "P" or "parameter" file, which lists all the parameter values in one list;
        </li>
        <li>
          an "R" or "region" file, which lists two points that bound the region;
        </li>
        <li>
          a "W" or "weight" file, which lists the weight for each abscissa;
        </li>
        <li>
          an "X" or "abscissa" file, which lists the abscissas of the rule.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The abscissas are ordered to respect the natural nesting of the
      sparse grids by level.  That is, the file of level 3 points begins by
      listing the points in the level 2 grid.
    </p>

      Example:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The "R" file stores two points that define the
      "corners" of the region.  Here is the R file for a 2D rule based on
      1D rules that both are defined in [-1,+1].
      <pre><code>
     -1.000000     -1.000000
      1.000000     +1.000000
      </code></pre>
      In cases where one or both endpoints are infinite, the infinite value
      is suggested by using the value 1.0E+30.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Here is the text of a "W" file, which stores the weights of rule:
      <pre><code>
     -0.444444
      1.111111
      1.111111
      1.111111
      1.111111
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Here is the text of an "X" file storing the abscissas of a 
      rule of dimension 2:
      <pre><code>
      0.000000      0.000000
     -0.774596      0.000000
      0.774596      0.000000
      0.000000     -0.774596
      0.000000      0.774596
