    <p>
      <b>triangle</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      can compute properties of a triangle, including angles, area, centroid, circumcircle,
      edge lengths, incircle, orientation, orthocenter, and quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      These properties include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Angles;
        </li>
        <li>
          Area;
        </li>
        <li>
          Centroid;
        </li>
        <li>
          Circumcircle (center and radius);
        </li>
        <li>
          Edge lengths;
        </li>
        <li>
          Incircle (center and radius);
        </li>
        <li>
          Orientation;
        </li>
        <li>
          Orthocenter;
        </li>
        <li>
          Quality: ratio of incircle radius / circumcircle radius;
        </li>
      </ul>
