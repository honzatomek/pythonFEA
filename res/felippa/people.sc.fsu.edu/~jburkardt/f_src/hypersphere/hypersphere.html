      <b>hypersphere</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      carries out various operations for an M-dimensional hypersphere, including 
      converting between Cartesian and spherical coordinates, 
      stereographic projection, sampling the surface of the sphere, and
      computing the surface area and volume.
