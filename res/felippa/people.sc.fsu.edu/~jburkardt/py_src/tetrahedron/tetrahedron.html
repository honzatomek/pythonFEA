      <b>tetrahedron</b>,
      a Python code which
      carries out geometric calculations involving a general tetrahedron,
      including solid and facial angles, face areas,
      point containment, distances to a point, circumsphere and insphere,
      measures of shape quality, centroid, barycentric coordinates,
      edges and edge lengths, random sampling, and volumes.
