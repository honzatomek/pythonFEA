      <b>ellipse_test</b>,
      a C++ code which 
      calls ellipse(), which
      carries out geometric calculations for ellipses and ellipsoids, including
      area, distance to a point, eccentricity, perimeter, points along the 
      perimeter, random sampling, conversion between standard and quadratic forms.
