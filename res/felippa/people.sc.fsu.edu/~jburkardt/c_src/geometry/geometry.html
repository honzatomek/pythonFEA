    <p>
      <b>geometry</b>,
      a C code which 
      performs certain geometric calculations in 2, 3 and N space.
    </p>

    <p>
      These calculations include angles, areas, containment, distances, 
      intersections, lengths, and volumes.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Some geometric objects can be described in a variety of ways.
      For instance, a line has implicit, explicit and parametric
      representations.  The names of routines often will specify
      the representation used, and there are routines to convert
      from one representation to another.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another useful task is the delineation of a standard geometric
      object.  For instance, there is a routine that will return
      the location of the vertices of an octahedron, and others to
      produce a series of "equally spaced" points on a circle, ellipse,
      sphere, or within the interior of a triangle.
