      <b>two_body_ode</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      sets up and solves ordinary differential equations (ODE) which
      simulate the behavior of two bodies, constrained to lie in a plane,
      moving under the influence of gravity, with one body much more massive 
      than the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two bodies, regarded as point masses, are constrained to lie in a plane.
      The masses of each body are given, as are the positions and velocities
      at a starting time T = 0.  The bodies move in accordance with the gravitational
      force between them.  One body is assume to be much more massive than the other.
      Therefore, the common motion of the two bodies about their center of mass
      can be approximated by assuming that the large body remains fixed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under these assumptions, Newton's equations for (x(t),y(t)), the positition 
      of the lighter body with respect to the heavy body at (0,0), can be written as:
      <pre>
        r(t) = sqrt ( x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 )
        x''(t) = - x(t) / r^3
        y''(t) = - y(t) / r^3
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      These two second order equations can be rewritten as a system of four
      first order equations using the variable u = [ x(t), x'(t), y(t), y'(t) ],
      resulting in the equations:
      <pre>
        r = sqrt ( u(1)^2 + u(3)^2 )
        u'(1) =   u(2)
        u'(2) = - u(1) / r^3
        u'(3) =   u(4)
        u'(4) = - u(3) / r^3
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      By specifying some initial condition for u, the system can then be
      integrated in time using a standard ODE solver.
