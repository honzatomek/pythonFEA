      <b>sir_ode</b>,
      a MATLAB code which
      sets up and solves the ordinary differential equations (ODE) which
      simulate the spread of a disease
      using the Susceptible/Infected/Recovered (SIR) model.
    </p>

    <p>
      We consider the evolution of a disease epidemic in a population of
      N people.
    </p>

    <p>
      We assume that the patients can be classified as Susceptible, Infected or
      Recovering, with the properties that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Susceptible</i>: A patient who has never been infected with the
          disease.  A susceptible patient can become infected, with
          an infectivity coefficient alpha.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Infected</i>: A patient who was susceptible, and has now contracted
          the disease.  Infected patients can spread the disease to susceptible
          patients.  An infected patient can become recovered, with recovery 
          coefficient beta.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Recovered</i>: A patient who was infectious, but has recovered.
          Such patients cannot contract the disease, and cannot transmit it.
          A recovered patient can become susceptible, with
          susceptibility coefficient gamma.
        </li>
      </ul>
