    <p>
      <b>xerror</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      collects information about errors that
      occur during a program's execution, and takes the appropriate
      action, which may include printing a message, diverting to
      a user routine, or aborting execution of the program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most users never encounter xerror directly.  However,
      they may receive warnings and other error messages produced
      by xerror, if the software they are calling has encountered
      an error condition and uses xerror to report and
      handle the problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      An experienced user or software developer may wish to incorporate
      xerror into software being developed, or to modify the
      behavior of xerror in software they are using.  The package
      includes many routines to customize its behavior, to reduce
      the level of output, to make multiple copies of the error output,
      to control the number of times a particular error message is printed,
      or to halt execution of the program if certain kinds of error occur.
