midpoint_explicit_test:
  MATLAB/Octave version 4.2.2
  Test midpoint_explicit() on several ODE's.
  We use a constant stepsize.

predator_prey_midpoint_explicit_test

  A pair of ordinary differential equations for a population
  of predators and prey are solved using midpoint_fixed().

  The exact solution shows periodic behavior, with a fixed
  period and amplitude.
