trapezoidal_test:
  MATLAB/Octave version 4.2.2
  Test the trapezoidal method on several ODE's.
  We use a constant stepsize.

predator_prey_trapezoidal():

  A pair of ordinary differential equations for a population
  of predators and prey are solved using trapezoidal().

  The exact solution shows periodic behavior, with a fixed
  period and amplitude.
