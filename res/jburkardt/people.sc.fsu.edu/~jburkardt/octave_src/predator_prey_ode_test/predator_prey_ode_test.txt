predator_prey_ode_test:
  MATLAB/Octave version 4.2.2
  Test predator_prey_ode using euler, midpoint, ode23, ode45.

predator_prey_euler 

  A pair of ordinary differential equations for a population
  of predators and prey are solved using euler().

  The exact solution shows periodic behavior, with a fixed
  period and amplitude.
